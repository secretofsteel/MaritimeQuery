When deciding on appropriate course and speed, consideration must be given to avoiding capsizing, damage through slamming, heavy rolling, and longitudinal or torsional stresses.\n    *   [1, N 010 - Navigation in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storm (Laminated) > OOW: Carry out the following in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storms]\n    *   [2, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Collision Regulations in Restricted Visibility]\n    *   [3, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Dangerous Phenomena during Heavy Weather]\n\n2.  **Ensure Stability and Watertight Integrity:**\n    It is mandatory to ascertain that the ship complies with the stability criteria specified in the Intact Stability Code and to take measures to assure the shipâ€™s watertight integrity. This includes confirming that all weather deck openings (doors/hatches) are closed and secured, anchors are properly lashed, mooring winches are secured, and all loose or movable items throughout the ship (deck, bridge, engine room, galley, storerooms, and accommodation) are secured.\n    *   [1, N 010 - Navigation in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storm (Laminated) > OOW: Carry out the following in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storms]\n    *   [2, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Collision Regulations in Restricted Visibility]\n\n3.  **Engage Manual Steering and Inform Key Personnel:**\n    The OOW must engage manual steering and ensure that the Bridge Watch Condition and Engine Room status are appropriate. The Master, Chief Engineer, and the E/R must be informed regarding the weather conditions, and crew members must be informed about the weather and the need to avoid upper deck areas made dangerous by the conditions.\n    *   [1, N 010 - Navigation in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storm (Laminated) > OOW: Carry out the following in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storms]\n    *   [2, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Collision Regulations in Restricted Visibility]", "confidence_pct": 82, "confidence_level": "HIGH ðŸŸ¢", "confidence_note": "Based on clear documentation.", "sources": [{"source": "CHECK_N_010_NAVIGATION_IN_HEAVY_WEATHER_AND_TROPICAL_STORM_(LAMINATED).docx", "section": "OOW: Carry out the following in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storms", "score": 0.8080827, "title": "N 010 - Navigation in Heavy Weather and Tropical Storm (Laminated)", "doc_type": "Checklist", "hierarchy": "N 010", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "N 010", "form_category_name": "Navigation"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Collision Regulations in Restricted Visibility", "score": 0.6426349, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Dangerous Phenomena during Heavy Weather", "score": 0.60694176, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Access to Main Deck during Heavy Weather", "score": 0.47943115, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Restricted Visibility", "score": 0.47168615, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Weather Forecast", "score": 0.4042963, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Man Overboard (M.O.B)", "score": 0.3813814, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Dangerous Phenomena during Heavy Weather", "score": 0.35864556, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Tropical Revolving Storm (TRS)", "score": 0.33163956, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}, {"source": "Chapter 7.2.docx", "section": "Calling the Master", "score": 0.2915105, "title": "Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION", "doc_type": "Policy", "hierarchy": "Chapter 7.2", "tab_name": "", "form_number": "", "form_category_name": "N"}], "num_sources": 30, "retriever_type": "hybrid"}
