The refrigerator and freezer compartments must operate under conditions which will prevent the development of bacteria and ensure your food is preserved properly. Monitor the temperatures of the refrigerated rooms in predetermined intervals. Fluctuating temperatures may cause an accumulation of ice deposits. Calibrate refrigerators and freezers’ thermometers to monitor fridge temperature. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved.\n\nKeeping a Temperature Log is the indicative way to refrigerator and freezer temperatures proper monitoring. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved.

Eliminate the risks of cross contamination by thoroughly stripping and cleaning the relevant parts of equipment when successive different foods are to be used (especially raw and cooked foods).\n\nDo note place defrosting food anywhere near cooked food, or preparation counters. There is a high risk of food contamination caused by the leaking fluids.\n\nThe Right Refrigerator Temperatures\nAs a rule, the interior temperature of a refrigerator varies between 30C and 50C, with Food Safety Organizations recommending that the ideal temperature must be set below 40C.\n\nKeep in mind that the temperature is not the same at different levels of your refrigerator. As a rule, the bottom of the fridge is the coldest and the temperature rises as you climb. For example, on the middle shelf, the average temperature is approximately 50C, while the lowest shelves are colder, at about 20C. This is why you should place different foods in different levels, depending on their needs in terms of temperature:\n\nStore your vegetables and fruits in the bottom drawers.\n\nPut your dairy and deli products on the middle shelf.\n\nStore precooked and ready to eat items on the top shelf.\n\nAvoid overloading the refrigerator. An overstock can impede the free circulation of air, which can lead to both warm and cold pockets in the refrigerator that can speed up spoilage. However, at the other extreme, you should also keep in mind that a refrigerator left virtually empty will consume more energy than a well-stocked one."}, {"name": "Housekeeping and Maintenance of Refrigerators and Freezers Guide", "content": "Keep refrigerated spaces in clean and sanitary condition.\n\nStore food securely.\n\nKeep shelves, racks, gratings, refrigerating coils and rails free of scraps of food and packaging material.\n\nProperly dispose scraps of vegetables and decayed fruits in garbage disposal facilities, as soon as identified.\n\nKeep scuppers free for proper drainage.\n\nKeep refrigerated spaces ventilated to prevent damage to provisions.\n\nEntry into these spaces is restricted to minimum necessary for efficient operation.\n\nCook: Notify the C/E when it is intended to wash refrigerators or chill rooms. In the event of technical problems with refrigeration plant, follow the C/E's recommendations concerning frequency of access to chambers.\n\nKeep all rooms thoroughly clean and hygienic.\n\nKeep refrigerators in mess rooms and pantries in clean and sanitary condition at all times.\n\nRemove any solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) used as packaging for frozen goods in transit to the vessel, before goods are placed in refrigerated rooms."}, {"name": "Safety procedures when working in refrigerated spaces", "content": "No one enters a refrigerated room without first informing a responsible person who must be instructed to raise the alarm if an absence is prolonged.\n\nThe space or flat in which refrigerated machinery is installed must be adequately ventilated and illuminated.\n\nAll refrigerated rooms must have means of opening the door from the inside and an inside alarm button which must be tested at least weekly.\n\nThose likely to enter the refrigerated spaces must make themselves familiar, in the dark, with the alarm and the release systems.\n\nAlways secure refrigerators doors, when opened. Do not allow it to swing freely.\n\nIf padlocks are fitted, take the padlock inside, when entering the space.\n\nKeep all doors to refrigerated rooms securely closed and locked at all times and, when closed, extinguish all lights.\n\nFreon gas, when heated, gives off toxic fumes. Entirely empty all lines and machinery of gas before commencing any hot work repairs. Keep thereafter the appropriate valves open to prevent pressure build up.\n\nNo one enters the refrigerated space if leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected (freon has a distinctive oily smell). In this event:\n\nPost a warning notice on the respective doors.\n\nFollow “Enclosed Space” precautions before entering a space suspected or known to be contaminated with leaking refrigerant which can displace air and cause suffocation.\n\nIf it is necessary to enter the space where a leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected, the space must be thoroughly ventilated and those entering be protected by breathing apparatus.\n\nWear adequate clothing for protection against cold conditions when entering in refrigerated spaces.\n\nPersonnel charging or repairing refrigeration plant must be fully aware of the necessary precautions when handling refrigerant.\n\nCold stores or refrigerated rooms should not be entered if it is suspected that there has been a leakage of refrigerant, or there is a shortage of oxygen.\n\nA warning notice to this effect should be posted outside the doors.\n\nIn freezer units, the combination of high humidity and fluctuating temperatures (warmer than minus 10˚C) accelerate mold and other spoilage bacterial growth.

The refrigerator and freezer compartments must operate under conditions which will prevent the development of bacteria and ensure your food is preserved properly. Monitor the temperatures of the refrigerated rooms in predetermined intervals. Fluctuating temperatures may cause an accumulation of ice deposits. Calibrate refrigerators and freezers’ thermometers to monitor fridge temperature. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved.\\n\\nKeeping a Temperature Log is the indicative way to refrigerator and freezer temperatures proper monitoring. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved. Assign this task to a designated Galley crewmember and make sure that time, air, temperature and his name and signature are properly logged.

Eliminate the risks of cross contamination by thoroughly stripping and cleaning the relevant parts of equipment when successive different foods are to be used (especially raw and cooked foods).\\n\\nDo note place defrosting food anywhere near cooked food, or preparation counters. There is a high risk of food contamination caused by the leaking fluids.\\n\\nThe Right Refrigerator Temperatures\\nAs a rule, the interior temperature of a refrigerator varies between 30C and 50C, with Food Safety Organizations recommending that the ideal temperature must be set below 40C.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the temperature is not the same at different levels of your refrigerator. As a rule, the bottom of the fridge is the coldest and the temperature rises as you climb. For example, on the middle shelf, the average temperature is approximately 50C, while the lowest shelves are colder, at about 20C. This is why you should place different foods in different levels, depending on their needs in terms of temperature:\\n\\nStore your vegetables and fruits in the bottom drawers.\\n\\nPut your dairy and deli products on the middle shelf.\\n\\nStore precooked and ready to eat items on the top shelf.\\n\\nAvoid overloading the refrigerator. An overstock can impede the free circulation of air, which can lead to both warm and cold pockets in the refrigerator that can speed up spoilage. However, at the other extreme, you should also keep in mind that a refrigerator left virtually empty will consume more energy than a well-stocked one.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Housekeeping and Maintenance of Refrigerators and Freezers Guide\",\n      \"content\": \"Keep refrigerated spaces in clean and sanitary condition.\\n\\nStore food securely.\\n\\nKeep shelves, racks, gratings, refrigerating coils and rails free of scraps of food and packaging material.\\n\\nProperly dispose scraps of vegetables and decayed fruits in garbage disposal facilities, as soon as identified.\\n\\nKeep scuppers free for proper drainage.\\n\\nKeep refrigerated spaces ventilated to prevent damage to provisions.\\n\\nEntry into these spaces is restricted to minimum necessary for efficient operation.\\n\\nCook: Notify the C/E when it is intended to wash refrigerators or chill rooms.

Alternatively, if the blood concentration is in mg/100 ml, then a level of 40mg/100 ml blood is equivalent to ½oo x 40 = 0.20 mg/l measured by the breathalyzer and vice-versa.

However, alarms and indications can be generated with the manual addition, during passage planning, e.g., of clearing lines, ship safety contour lines, isolated danger markers and danger areas to mitigate these limitations.\n• Horizontal datums and chart projections may differ between RNCs. Mariners must understand how a chart's horizontal datum relates to the datum of the position fixing system in use. In some instances, this may appear as a shift in position. This difference may be most noticeable at grid intersections.\n• A number of RNCs cannot be referenced to either WGS-84 or PE 90 geodetic datums. Where this is the case, ECDIS must give a continuous indication.\n• The display of RNCs features cannot be simplified by the removal of features to suit a particular navigational circumstance or task. This could affect the superimposition of radar/ARPA.\n• Without selecting different scale charts, the look-ahead capability may be limited. This may lead to inconvenience when determining range and bearing or the identity of distant objects.\n• Orientation of the RCDS display to other than chart-up may affect the readability of chart text and symbols (e.g., course-up, route-up).\n• It is not possible to interrogate RNC features to gain additional information about charted objects. Whether using ENC or RNC in the planning process, consult all relevant publications (such as sailing directions, etc.).\n• With RNC, it is not possible to display a ship's safety contour or depth and highlight it on the display unless these features are manually entered during route planning.\n• Depending on the source of RNC, different colors may be used to show similar chart information. There may also be differences in colors used during day and night time.\n• A RNC is intended to be used at the scale of the equivalent paper chart. Excessive zooming in or out can degrade the displayed image. If the RNC is displayed at a larger scale than the equivalent paper chart, the ECDIS will provide an indication.\n• ECDIS provides an indication in the ENC which allows a determination of the quality of hydrographic the data.

For example, when calculating the UKC, the sounding datum is taken, and the tidal height applied to this. Similarly, when considering the vertical clearance, e.g., the air draft, be aware of the datum details for the ENC.\nOOW:\n• When transiting from area to area, the datum can change, but the ECDIS may not alarm to show there has been a change in the datum. Therefore:\n  o Monitor the “pick report” function on the ECDIS.\n  o Consider any variants in the passage plan, in particular for UKC and air drafts.\n• For vertical and sounding datums, there is on occasion more than one datum used for any ENC area cell. This can override the general information datum on the ENC, therefore check the “pick report” function for the vertical datum of data and the sounding datum of data, known as M_VDAT and M_SDAT respectively.\n• Exercise caution with respect to physical object datum, such as bridges, as these may be based on different datums; check each object individually during passage planning.\n11.3.2 Horizontal Datum\nHorizontal datum is commonly WGS84, and this is the case with ENCs so that the ship position is compatible with the charted information. Where it is not possible to position the information on the chart to WGS84 datum, inaccuracies may exist in ENC. In this case the ship’s position will essentially be correct, however the charted information, for example the coastline, maybe out of position relative to ship owing to a different datum.

AVCS Folios and ENC Units may be added to an AVCS licence at any time for periods of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months (where data supply agreements allow). This offers maximum choice and the flexibility to match your chart holdings to your operational patterns.\nWhen they are loaded into the ECDIS, ENCs are converted to the system’s own proprietary format, known as System ENC (SENC). To allow them to load more efficiently, some service providers convert AVCS ENCs to SENC ashore, then send them to the vessel, usually by download.\nBefore loading AVCS ENCs, the ENC Permits must be installed on the system. Each permit is unique and is the method which provides access to the required ENCs. The ENC Permits are supplied by the ENC service provider in a zipped file. The contents of this file will depend on the number of ECDIS units onboard, as each AVCS license allows for use on up to five ECDIS. When extracted, one or more set of permit files (PERMIT.TXT and ENC.PMT) will be copied automatically into folder(s) named MASTER, BACKUP, RESERVE1, RESERVE2 and RESERVE3, depending on the number of ECDIS configured on the bridge.\nMost ENC Producers grant permission for their data to be displayed many times on a single vessel licence. However, where permission is restricted to a smaller number of ECDIS displays, those permits will only be included in the appropriate number of permit files, in the order given above. It is therefore important that priority displays are identified correctly on your licence otherwise some data may not be available when needed.\nThe permits must be extracted to a physical media, e.g., USB flash drive, separately by email, downloaded over the internet, or directly from back of bridge software applications. The contents should be extracted to a file location that is capable of being read by the ECDIS system (read the ENC distributor’s Manual).\nA new set of ENC Permits will be supplied by the ENC distributor whenever an ENC has been added or removed from the ship’s licence. These should be installed on the ECDIS when they are received, before loading any new exchange sets.\nThe company has decided to proceed with PAYS subscriptions, providing the managed ships with permits for the majority of the AVCS portfolio, so they are available for voyage planning. Basis to this agreement with the ENC distributor the Master and the Navigating Officers will avoid having to purchase the ENCs individually. The ship is only charged for their use when your vessel tracks across the coverage of each ENC.\nCAUTION\nThe ENC data must still be loaded onto your ECDIS either manually or automatically.\nNote\nMaster and Navigation Officer: Report to ENC service provider the instances where an ENC cell has failed to install.

Understanding of these symbols is critical to interpreting the accuracy of presented survey data and establishing appropriate safe margins (see Paragraph 11).\nNavigation Officer:\n• Check the data quality (CATZOC) function for the entire passage plan.\n• Identify the low accuracies of positions and depths.\nLower CATZOC ratings (C, D or U) indicate that a wider safety margin (including both horizontally and vertically) between the ship’s planned track and hazards or dangers must be allowed.\nCAUTION\n15.1.7 Other Considerations\nCompleting an appraisal report, a list of factors, depending on the type of the ship and the geographic area through which the passage is planned, must be evaluated.\nNavigation Officer: Consider the following factors:\n• Routeing:\n  o Anchorage(s), No-go areas, Safe waters, Crossing traffic\n  o Ballast water exchange\n  o Bridge manning\n  o Restricted navigational areas, Landfall targets and lights\n  o Environmental factors, including ice navigation\n  o Transit in proximity to navigational hazards\n  o Environmental protection areas (e.g., ECAs)\n  o IALA buoyage systems\n  o Speed limits and restrictions\n  o Pilotage requirements\n  o Precautionary and Security areas\n  o Territorial waters\n  o Time zones and time changes\n  o Traffic density, Traffic separation scheme (TSS), other routeing measures\n  o VTS and ship reporting systems.\n• Contingencies:\n  o For emergencies/equipment failures/breakdowns\n  o Potential areas to conduct drifting and/or proceed to anchorage\n  o Points of non-return/abort points\n  o Where there is a deterioration in the weather conditions\n  o For customs/medical/quarantine reasons\n  o Place of refuge\n  o For operations such as gas freeing, purging, ballast water exchange.\n15.1.8 Advising the Master\nOnce the Appraisal Report (N 002) has been completed, the detailed planning can begin.\nNavigation Officer:\nAdvise the Master accordingly."}, {"name": "15.2 Route Planning", "content": "Following the appraisal of all charts, publications and other information, prepare a route plan to cover the entire passage from berth to berth, including those areas where a pilot is needed.\nNote\nIf the destination has not been confirmed, plan a passage from berth to a point the ship is expected to sail towards.\n15.2.1 Display Configuration\nENCs provide a layering of information, much of which can be turned on / off by selecting the relevant display category. To ensure that all relevant information for planning the route is shown, configure display settings prior to route construction, as per Company’s requirements.\nNote\nGuidelines for ECDIS Display Management are provided in Appendix 3.\nNavigation Officer:\n• Configure the ENC settings to enable efficient planning, initially:\n  o Unload all routes/manual layers\n  o Select full screen\n  o Set default values for safety depth, safety contours, cross track corridor and radius turn\n  o Select compilation scale to ensure that ECDIS screen displays features at the most optimum scale\n  o Select “All” display mode and appropriate palette\n  o Allow autoload and autoscale.\n• Enter the display of auxiliary layers, provided by integration with other software or equipment:\n  o AIO\n  o NAVTEX\n  o Route Planning Software\n  o Tidal Streams / Surface Currents and Weather data.\nNote\nSelect chart symbols (pick report) on ENCs to get additional detailed safety and navigational information.\n15.2.2 Alarm Configuration\nThe proper alarm configuration on ECDIS is very important. During the route validation stage of the passage planning, alarms will assist the Navigation Officer in checking that there are no dangers on the route. While at sea, alarms monitoring the passage plan assist the OOW by ensuring they are aware of new or unexpected hazards or dangers.\nNote\nGuidelines for ECDIS Alarm Management is provided in Appendix 4.\nThe following alarm categories are installed on the ECDIS:\n• Emergency Alarm: The highest level of an alert as it signifies immediate danger and that immediate action must be taken.\n• Alarm: A high priority of alert. Condition requiring immediate attention and action, to maintain the safe navigation and operation of the ship.\n• Warning: Condition requiring no immediate attention or action. Warnings are presented for precautionary reasons to bring awareness of changed conditions which are not immediately hazardous but may become so if no action is taken.\n• Caution: Lowest priority of an alert. Awareness of a condition which does not warrant an alarm or warning condition, but still requires attention out of the ordinary consideration of situation or of given information.\nNavigation Officer:\n• Ensure that alarms are turned on - test them to ensure that they are audible.\n• Set the alarm parameters as per Company’s procedures and in a manner that reduces alarm fatigue.\n• Receive the Master’s agreement, regarding the alarm setting parameters, and record them to the relevant passage plan form N 001.\n15.2.3 Route Creation\nNavigation Officer: The objective is to use all information obtained during the appraisal, to create the safest possible route.\n• Take into account any relevant ship’s routeing system.\n• Ensure that sufficient sea room for safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage is available.\n• Anticipate all known navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions.\nAvoid, where possible, to pass from environmental sensitive areas.\nCAUTION\n• Adjust a planned route alphanumerically (route table) and graphically (on screen), including:\n  o Adding waypoints to a route\n  o Deleting waypoints from a route\n  o Shifting the position of a waypoint.\n• Plan one or more alternative routes in addition to the active route.\n• Distinguish the active route from other routes.\n• Initiate the relevant passage planning checklist N 003.\n• Note\nRecord details of each leg in the passage planning sheet (N 001) for reference during both the current and any future voyages between the same Ports.\nAn arrangement of separate routes:\n• Berth to pilot station\n• Pilot station to pilot station\n• Pilot station to berth\nmay be constructed and then incorporated together in the passage plan, ensuring that coverage is still berth to berth (a route must be created from berth to berth as a single route).\n15.2.3.1 New Route\nNavigation Officer:\n• Open the route planning function and select “new route”.\n• Ensure that appropriate largest scale ENCs are used.\n• Ensure that the compilation scale of each ENC is used.\n• Pay particular attention to where ENCs overlap.\nA detailed check is essential where ENCs overlap, to ensure that no critical data has been obscured. Overlapping cells are listed in the README file (see Paragraph 7.8 ).\nCAUTION\n• Add waypoints:\n  o Use the graphical method to construct a route. On an appropriately scaled ENC, start by adding a waypoint in the vicinity of the initial location using the cursor. When 2 waypoints are inserted, the system automatically joins them to form legs, which are rhumb lines by default. Remaining on small scale ENCs, and utilizing the knowledge received during appraisal stage, construct the route by adding all necessary waypoints till the final destination. Waypoints position need only be approximate at this stage, or\n  o Use the tabular method, where the latitude and longitude of waypoints are entered manually in the route table. Leg details such as true course and distance, can be viewed in the route table or chosen display, where available, along the route itself.\n• Adjust waypoints. Once the entire route is planned on small scale charts, return to the start position and conduct a more accurate planning by fine-tuning the waypoints, using appropriate large-scale charts. Place waypoints as accurately as possible.\n• Note\nA route planning software can be used to create and review optimum voyage routes. The software is integrated with chart management and ordering tools, overlays of NAVAREA warnings, etc.\n• Consider the following when adding or adjusting waypoints:\n  o Ship considerations:\n     Draft in relation to available depth and width of navigable water and minimum required UKC\n     Effect on ship’s draft and turning circle during course alteration:\n- Planned speed\n- ROT restrictions\n- Effect of expected tidal stream\n- Effect of expected current\n- Increase in draft due to squat and heel effect.\n     Optimal fuel efficiency.\n  o Route considerations:\n     Adequate XTC\n     Alterations of speed enroute\n     Avoidance of danger areas\n     Contingency/emergency planning:\n- Points of non-return\n- Place of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of an emergency\n- Shore-based emergency response arrangements and equipment.\n     Depth of water, Tidal restrictions\n     Limitations of night passage\n     Location of course alterations\n     Method and frequency of position verification\n     Piracy and security\n     Pilot station(s). Place a waypoint at the pilot station to ensure accurate ETA\n     Protection of the environment\n     Safe speed and proximity of navigational hazards\n     Territorial baselines\n     Use of ship’s routeing, reporting systems and VTS.\nNote\nBy default, ECDIS will create legs as rhumb lines, but for ocean passages this can be changed to a Great Circle line.\n• Plot specific details of T&P / EP NMs, navigational warnings, NAVTEX messages and local information as a manual layer and made alarmable by using the look-ahead feature to highlight the navigational hazards for the OOW. The manual layers must be displayed at least within 50 nm on either side of the planned track.\n• Define the ship’s safe speed for each leg of the planned route.\n• Apply any guidance or direction related to ship’s route as per the charterers orders.\n• Calculate the safety depths and safety contours and set them up in line with the UKC requirements (see Paragraph 13 ).\n• Set maximum acceptable cross track corridor (XTC) to each leg of a route (see Paragraph 13.9 ).\n• Define the look-ahead zone (see Paragraph 13.8)\n• Set parallel indexing where appropriate.\n• Define abort points, critical points and emergency anchorages.\n• Calculate the wheel-over positions with the applicable rate of turn.\n• Plot no-go areas.\n• Set ETA using the route planning tools. Be aware that if this is set incorrectly, it may affect tidal data, UKC calculations and time dependent information for the route.\n• Note\nWhen the ship regularly visits a certain Port or frequently transits an area, it is advantageous to keep the whole or part of the passage plan as it is. Unless changes are made to channels, navaids, etc. a planned passage is acceptable for future visits, taking into account the meteorological and tidal differences and that inward and outward passages may be different. Parts of the plans may have common features that can be used.\nIf reusing a previous passage plan, then recheck the route to confirm that it remains safe and no changes are necessary.\nCAUTION\nWhen planning, consider the following:\nOpen Sea\nOcean routeing charts showing ocean currents, winds, ice limits and load lines\nLoad line charts showing zones and seasonal periods ensure compliance with the IMO International Convention on Load Lines\nWeather routeing services (if applicable)\nThe use of gnomonic projection charts for plotting great circle routes, as appropriate\nOcean currents and their impact on ship speed and fuel consumption\nWeather conditions, including anticipated seasonal variations, e.g., heavy weather, tropical storms, ice and reduced visibility\nEnvironmental protection measures and requirements that may extend into an ocean route\nCoastal Waters\nThe importance of passing charted and other features at a safe distance\nAdvice in the sailing directions\nAvailable depth of water and tidal information contained in tide tables/stream atlases\nAvailability of visual and radar fixing opportunities\nShip’s routeing and reporting measures, as well as the availability of VTS\nThe reliability of the ship’s propulsion and steering system\nEnvironmental protection measures and requirements, including fuel changeover\nConfined / Pilotage Waters\nRecommended routes and channel information\nProcedures for pilotage, including pilot boarding points and means of embarkation\nLocal conditions, rules and restrictions on navigation\nReporting and communications procedures\nDetails of the prospective berth, tugs and/or anchorages\nContingency planning for unforeseen issues\n15.2.3.2 Route Supplementary Information\nInserting “anger highlights” using manual layers, ensures that the OOW is informed and reminded of potential dangers and actions to be taken at various points during the passage.\nThe quantity of additional information must be limited to that which is necessary to execute the route with safety and efficiency, although this will depend on industry best practices and:\n• The complexity of the plan\n• The environmental conditions\n• The proximity of dangers\n• The Master’s standing orders.\nNavigation Officer: Include the following additional info, as minimum, when applicable:\n• Parallel indexing, methods and frequency of position verification\n• Landfall targets and lights\n• Clearing lines and bearings\n• Transits, heading marks and"}], "multi_pass_extraction": true, "num_passes": 1, "ocr_used": false, "category": "N", "extraction_warning": "Missing 56 sections"}}
