Eliminate the risks of cross contamination by thoroughly stripping and cleaning the relevant parts of equipment when successive different foods are to be used (especially raw and cooked foods).\n\nDo note place defrosting food anywhere near cooked food, or preparation counters. There is a high risk of food contamination caused by the leaking fluids.\n\nThe Right Refrigerator Temperatures\nAs a rule, the interior temperature of a refrigerator varies between 30C and 50C, with Food Safety Organizations recommending that the ideal temperature must be set below 40C.\n\nKeep in mind that the temperature is not the same at different levels of your refrigerator. As a rule, the bottom of the fridge is the coldest and the temperature rises as you climb. For example, on the middle shelf, the average temperature is approximately 50C, while the lowest shelves are colder, at about 20C. This is why you should place different foods in different levels, depending on their needs in terms of temperature:\n\nStore your vegetables and fruits in the bottom drawers.\n\nPut your dairy and deli products on the middle shelf.\n\nStore precooked and ready to eat items on the top shelf.\n\nAvoid overloading the refrigerator. An overstock can impede the free circulation of air, which can lead to both warm and cold pockets in the refrigerator that can speed up spoilage.

More specifically, we process passport, identity and\ncontact information, training and education data, prior and current employment information, background security checks,\nphoto, your application to the Company and your communications with it, as well as any other data necessary in connection\nwith the purposes described below.\n1.2 The Company will retain your personal data for six (6) months after the completion of the selection process in relation to\nthe position, for which you have applied. This period may be extended, if this is required in order for the Company to comply\nwith its legal obligations towards the competent authorities or third parties, due to applicable provisions on data retention\nperiods or in order for the Company to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If your application is successful, we will\ninform you about the new applicable retention periods.\n1.3 We process your data in order to select the appropriate personnel for the position for which you have applied pursuant to\nour recruitment criteria, to comply with our legal obligations, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims and to ensure the\nsafety of our staff, our premises and of the vessels we manage. If you provide your consent, we will process your data in\norder to select the appropriate personnel for a future position, other than that for which you have applied.\n2. Third party data transfers\nWe will not transfer your personal data to any third parties to the extent that your application is not successful or unless such\ntransfer is required by law or by an order of a competent authority.\n3.

So far as the processing relies upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time. To\nexercise your rights, please contact us as stated below at 5.\n4. Legal basis for processing\nThe Company processes your personal data because the processing is necessary in order for the Company to:\n(a) take steps at your request prior to entering into an employment agreement with you;\n(b) process your data for the purposes your consent, where applicable; and/or\n(c) to pursue its legitimate interests, such as to comply with its employee-related procedures, to fulfil its manning needs, to\nensure the safety and security of its staff, of the vessels it manages and of its premises, to comply with its legal obligations\nand with industry-specific requirements imposed by charterers, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims and to identify\ncandidates;\n(d) to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nThe provision of some of the above personal data is required by law or by contract.

However, alarms and indications can be generated with the manual addition, during passage planning, e.g., of clearing lines, ship safety contour lines, isolated danger markers and danger areas to mitigate these limitations.\n• Horizontal datums and chart projections may differ between RNCs. Mariners must understand how a chart's horizontal datum relates to the datum of the position fixing system in use. In some instances, this may appear as a shift in position. This difference may be most noticeable at grid intersections.\n• A number of RNCs cannot be referenced to either WGS-84 or PE 90 geodetic datums. Where this is the case, ECDIS must give a continuous indication.\n• The display of RNCs features cannot be simplified by the removal of features to suit a particular navigational circumstance or task. This could affect the superimposition of radar/ARPA.\n• Without selecting different scale charts, the look-ahead capability may be limited. This may lead to inconvenience when determining range and bearing or the identity of distant objects.\n• Orientation of the RCDS display to other than chart-up may affect the readability of chart text and symbols (e.g., course-up, route-up).\n• It is not possible to interrogate RNC features to gain additional information about charted objects. Whether using ENC or RNC in the planning process, consult all relevant publications (such as sailing directions, etc.).\n• With RNC, it is not possible to display a ship's safety contour or depth and highlight it on the display unless these features are manually entered during route planning.\n• Depending on the source of RNC, different colors may be used to show similar chart information. There may also be differences in colors used during day and night time.\n• A RNC is intended to be used at the scale of the equivalent paper chart. Excessive zooming in or out can degrade the displayed image. If the RNC is displayed at a larger scale than the equivalent paper chart, the ECDIS will provide an indication.\n• ECDIS provides an indication in the ENC which allows a determination of the quality of hydrographic the data. When using RNCs, consult the source diagram or the zone of confidence diagram, if available.\n(Source: MSC.1 / Circ. 1503/ Rev.1 – Appendix 2)"}, {"name": "8 ENC Display", "content": "8.1 Display Modes\nECDIS displays can be broadly divided into 4 types:\nDisplay Mode\nDescription\nConsist of\nBase\nProvides the minimum level of information.

AVCS Folios and ENC Units may be added to an AVCS licence at any time for periods of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months (where data supply agreements allow). This offers maximum choice and the flexibility to match your chart holdings to your operational patterns.\nWhen they are loaded into the ECDIS, ENCs are converted to the system’s own proprietary format, known as System ENC (SENC). To allow them to load more efficiently, some service providers convert AVCS ENCs to SENC ashore, then send them to the vessel, usually by download.\nBefore loading AVCS ENCs, the ENC Permits must be installed on the system. Each permit is unique and is the method which provides access to the required ENCs. The ENC Permits are supplied by the ENC service provider in a zipped file. The contents of this file will depend on the number of ECDIS units onboard, as each AVCS license allows for use on up to five ECDIS. When extracted, one or more set of permit files (PERMIT.TXT and ENC.PMT) will be copied automatically into folder(s) named MASTER, BACKUP, RESERVE1, RESERVE2 and RESERVE3, depending on the number of ECDIS configured on the bridge.\nMost ENC Producers grant permission for their data to be displayed many times on a single vessel licence. However, where permission is restricted to a smaller number of ECDIS displays, those permits will only be included in the appropriate number of permit files, in the order given above. It is therefore important that priority displays are identified correctly on your licence otherwise some data may not be available when needed.\nThe permits must be extracted to a physical media, e.g., USB flash drive, separately by email, downloaded over the internet, or directly from back of bridge software applications. The contents should be extracted to a file location that is capable of being read by the ECDIS system (read the ENC distributor’s Manual).\nA new set of ENC Permits will be supplied by the ENC distributor whenever an ENC has been added or removed from the ship’s licence. These should be installed on the ECDIS when they are received, before loading any new exchange sets.\nThe company has decided to proceed with PAYS subscriptions, providing the managed ships with permits for the majority of the AVCS portfolio, so they are available for voyage planning. Basis to this agreement with the ENC distributor the Master and the Navigating Officers will avoid having to purchase the ENCs individually. The ship is only charged for their use when your vessel tracks across the coverage of each ENC.\nCAUTION\nThe ENC data must still be loaded onto your ECDIS either manually or automatically.\nNote\nMaster and Navigation Officer: Report to ENC service provider the instances where an ENC cell has failed to install. These are normally identified by the ECDIS as fatal error or ENC failed import.

Although the passage plan will be constructed, refined and later activated on ECDIS for the execution and monitoring stages, the appraisal is a high-level overview. It must include supporting information such as UKC, draft, tidal streams, environmental considerations and ETAs. Such information must be documented along with supporting extracts from relevant publications.\nMaster:\n• Assign the designated Navigation Officer to determine the feasibility of the voyage.\n• Make the final decision on whether a Port or voyage is unsuitable or unsafe.\nMaster: NEVER proceed on voyage or enter a Port without necessary charts and publications for the voyage.\nCAUTION\nNavigation Officer:\n• Brief the Master if it appears at an early stage that the port, berth or voyage may not be suitable for the ship.\n• Take into consideration all available information and use approved publications, as per Flag requirements and industry best practices on the appraisal process.\n• Note\nFollow the passage plan appraisal checklist N 002 during the appraisal process, to verify that all information pertinent to the passage had been considered.\n15.1.1 Destination\nMaster / Navigation Officer: Consider the following:\n• Suitability of the ship, taking into account the following:\n  o Ship\n     Certification appropriate for the intendent voyage (e.g., ship sanitation)\n     Draft, including any reduction to UKC, other clearances (e.g., air draft)\n     Load line restrictions and requirements (i.e., compliance with applicable zones and seasonal conditions of the ICLL)\n     Equipment (i.e., mooring and anchoring equipment)\n     Maneuvering characteristics\n     Operational limitations and stability.\n  o Crew\n     Certification\n     Work and rest hours\n     Proper manning.\n  o Cargo and Bunkers\n     Special characteristics (e.g., hazardous cargo)\n     Distribution, stowage and securing onboard\n     Approval for intended cargo operations.\n     Bunkers consumption and safety margin\n  o Ports and berths\n     Compliance with Port State regulations and industry best practices (e.g., funnel emissions, ballast water treatment)\n     ISPS requirements\n     Inward and outward clearance process\n     Restrictions and limitations\n  o Other\n     Reporting/Charterer requirements\n     Medical/quarantine requirements\n     Additional security considerations (e.g., piracy areas, stowaways)\n     Pilotage considerations\n     Weather concerns (e.g., typhoons, ice etc.).\n• Calculate distance by using the ECDIS passage planning software or the ECDIS VRM. The distance can be verified by any alternative mean such as tabulated distance tables (see Ocean Passages for the World). The initial distance calculated will be an approximate distance; refine while the passage plan is developed.\n• Duration can be calculated using the distances established and the average safe speed. With this information it is applicable:\n  o To determine whether the ship can achieve any required ETA (if specified by the company and/or the charterer)\n  o To determine the ETA at specific points along the route at varying speeds. This allows consideration of UKC clearance and bridge team manning for areas requiring special attention.\nNote\nThe requirement for a safe speed must be considered for all legs of the voyage and entered in the ECDIS during the planning stage when the overall ETA/planned speeds are confirmed.\n15.1.2 Meteorology\nThe meteorological factors that may affect the passage need to be determined.\nNavigation Officer: Estimate the likely conditions of the intendent passage by gathering:\n• Climatological information by consulting routeing/pilot charts and sailing directions.\n• Forecast information by consulting weather charts.\n• Current data by consulting routeing/pilot charts and other sources. Consider the surface currents, as they can have a significant effect on the passage overall time.\n• Tidal data, including heights of tide and tidal streams by consulting the ECDIS and routeing charts/tidal stream atlases.\nNote\nThe Company may, in specific cases, arrange an access to third party weather routeing services delivered via email or via an online portal.\n15.1.3 Datums\nENC position data is referenced to horizontal datum, while depth and height data are referenced to a vertical datum and a sounding datum.\n15.1.3.1 Horizontal Datum\nAll ENCs use the WGS84 horizontal datum, which allows the seamless coverage of the entire world and ensures interoperability with existing GNSS equipment onboard (see Paragraph 11.3). Navigation Officer: Be aware that possible sources of errors of position for charted features may include datum discrepancies, survey errors, geographical changes and ENC production errors. Check that the horizontal datum in use for navigation is WGS84.\n15.1.3.2 UKC Calculation and Datum\nNavigation Officer:\n• Calculate the UKC by adding the height of tide (HoT) to the sounding datum.\n• Use the charted depth directly from ECDIS display, as each charted depth sounding is referenced to the ENC sounding datum.\n15.1.3.3 Vertical Clearance, Air Draft and Vertical Datum\nThe vertical and sounding datum are not standardized. Elevations and soundings will equate to those used on the equivalent paper chart and source data (see Paragraph 13)\nNavigation Officer:\n• Determine the difference between the sounding datum and the vertical datum when calculating the vertical clearance.\n• Use the pick report function to check the datum information and ensure that safe clearance calculations use the correct vertical datum.\n15.1.4 ENC Management and Installation\nObtain adequate ENCs for the entire passage in sufficient time to allow detailed planning and briefing of the passage to be carried out (see Paragraph 12).\nNote\nA list of ENCs needed for the intended voyage must be part of the appraisal.\nNavigation Officer:\n• Ensure that the ECDIS has all ENC cells of an appropriate scale installed for the planning stage (including a safety allowance of 50 nm on either side of the planned track for deviation/contingency).\n• The license of all ENCs planned to be used for the intended voyage must be valid for the entire voyage period.\n• Obtain licenses for and use the largest scale of ENCs available for all stages of each passage.\nCAUTION\n• Identify any ENCs missing from the ship’s folio and obtain them at the earliest opportunity from the authorized ENC distributor.\n• Proceed with a Risk Assessment if the intendent route could not be fully covered by the ENCs and inform the Office.\n15.1.5 ENC Updates\nECDIS maintains a list of updates applied and the date of application.\nNavigation Officer: Ensure that all ENCs planned to be used for the intended voyage are being kept up-to-date (see Paragraph 12).\n15.1.6 Areas of Low ENC Accuracy\nIn ENCs, the quality of survey data is displayed across the ENC using CATZOC symbols. Understanding of these symbols is critical to interpreting the accuracy of presented survey data and establishing appropriate safe margins (see Paragraph 11).\nNavigation Officer:\n• Check the data quality (CATZOC) function for the entire passage plan.\n• Identify the low accuracies of positions and depths.\nLower CATZOC ratings (C, D or U) indicate that a wider safety margin (including both horizontally and vertically) between the ship’s planned track and hazards or dangers must be allowed.\nCAUTION\n15.1.7 Other Considerations\nCompleting an appraisal report, a list of factors, depending on the type of the ship and the geographic area through which the passage is planned, must be evaluated.\nNavigation Officer: Consider the following factors:\n• Routeing:\n  o Anchorage(s), No-go areas, Safe waters, Crossing traffic\n  o Ballast water exchange\n  o Bridge manning\n  o Restricted navigational areas, Landfall targets and lights\n  o Environmental factors, including ice navigation\n  o Transit in proximity to navigational hazards\n  o Environmental protection areas (e.g., ECAs)\n  o IALA buoyage systems\n  o Speed limits and restrictions\n  o Pilotage requirements\n  o Precautionary and Security areas\n  o Territorial waters\n  o Time zones and time changes\n  o Traffic density, Traffic separation scheme (TSS), other routeing measures\n  o VTS and ship reporting systems.\n• Contingencies:\n  o For emergencies/equipment failures/breakdowns\n  o Potential areas to conduct drifting and/or proceed to anchorage\n  o Points of non-return/abort points\n  o Where there is a deterioration in the weather conditions\n  o For customs/medical/quarantine reasons\n  o Place of refuge\n  o For operations such as gas freeing, purging, ballast water exchange.\n15.1.8 Advising the Master\nOnce the Appraisal Report (N 002) has been completed, the detailed planning can begin.\nNavigation Officer:\nAdvise the Master accordingly."}, {"name": "15.2 Route Planning", "content": "Following the appraisal of all charts, publications and other information, prepare a route plan to cover the entire passage from berth to berth, including those areas where a pilot is needed.\nNote\nIf the destination has not been confirmed, plan a passage from berth to a point the ship is expected to sail towards.\n15.2.1 Display Configuration\nENCs provide a layering of information, much of which can be turned on / off by selecting the relevant display category. To ensure that all relevant information for planning the route is shown, configure display settings prior to route construction, as per Company’s requirements.\nNote\nGuidelines for ECDIS Display Management are provided in Appendix 3.\nNavigation Officer:\n• Configure the ENC settings to enable efficient planning, initially:\n  o Unload all routes/manual layers\n  o Select full screen\n  o Set default values for safety depth, safety contours, cross track corridor and radius turn\n  o Select compilation scale to ensure that ECDIS screen displays features at the most optimum scale\n  o Select “All” display mode and appropriate palette\n  o Allow autoload and autoscale.\n• Enter the display of auxiliary layers, provided by integration with other software or equipment:\n  o AIO\n  o NAVTEX\n  o Route Planning Software\n  o Tidal Streams / Surface Currents and Weather data.\nNote\nSelect chart symbols (pick report) on ENCs to get additional detailed safety and navigational information.\n15.2.2 Alarm Configuration\nThe proper alarm configuration on ECDIS is very important. During the route validation stage of the passage planning, alarms will assist the Navigation Officer in checking that there are no dangers on the route. While at sea, alarms monitoring the passage plan assist the OOW by ensuring they are aware of new or unexpected hazards or dangers.\nNote\nGuidelines for ECDIS Alarm Management is provided in Appendix 4.\nThe following alarm categories are installed on the ECDIS:\n• Emergency Alarm: The highest level of an alert as it signifies immediate danger and that immediate action must be taken.\n• Alarm: A high priority of alert. Condition requiring immediate attention and action, to maintain the safe navigation and operation of the ship.\n• Warning: Condition requiring no immediate attention or action. Warnings are presented for precautionary reasons to bring awareness of changed conditions which are not immediately hazardous but may become so if no action is taken.\n• Caution: Lowest priority of an alert. Awareness of a condition which does not warrant an alarm or warning condition, but still requires attention out of the ordinary consideration of situation or of given information.\nNavigation Officer:\n• Ensure that alarms are turned on - test them to ensure that they are audible.\n• Set the alarm parameters as per Company’s procedures and in a manner that reduces alarm fatigue.\n• Receive the Master’s agreement, regarding the alarm setting parameters, and record them to the relevant passage plan form N 001.\n15.2.3 Route Creation\nNavigation Officer: The objective is to use all information obtained during the appraisal, to create the safest possible route.\n• Take into account any relevant ship’s routeing system.\n• Ensure that sufficient sea room for safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage is available.\n• Anticipate all known navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions.\nAvoid, where possible, to pass from environmental sensitive areas.\nCAUTION\n• Adjust a planned route alphanumerically (route table) and graphically (on screen), including:\n  o Adding waypoints to a route\n  o Deleting waypoints from a route\n  o Shifting the position of a waypoint.\n• Plan one or more alternative routes in addition to the active route.\n• Distinguish the active route from other routes.\n• Initiate the relevant passage planning checklist N 003.\n• Note\nRecord details of each leg in the passage planning sheet (N 001) for reference during both the current and any future voyages between the same Ports.\nAn arrangement of separate routes:\n• Berth to pilot station\n• Pilot station to pilot station\n• Pilot station to berth\nmay be constructed and then incorporated together in the passage plan, ensuring that coverage is still berth to berth (a route must be created from berth to berth as a single route).\n15.2.3.1 New Route\nNavigation Officer:\n• Open the route planning function and select “new route”.\n• Ensure that appropriate largest scale ENCs are used.\n• Ensure that the compilation scale of each ENC is used.\n• Pay particular attention to where ENCs overlap.\nA detailed check is essential where ENCs overlap, to ensure that no critical data has been obscured. Overlapping cells are listed in the README file (see Paragraph 7.8 ).\nCAUTION\n• Add waypoints:\n  o Use the graphical method to construct a route. On an appropriately scaled ENC, start by adding a waypoint in the vicinity of the initial location using the cursor. When 2 waypoints are inserted, the system automatically joins them to form legs, which are rhumb lines by default. Remaining on small scale ENCs, and utilizing the knowledge received during appraisal stage, construct the route by adding all necessary waypoints till the final destination. Waypoints position need only be approximate at this stage, or\n  o Use the tabular method, where the latitude and longitude of waypoints are entered manually in the route table. Leg details such as true course and distance, can be viewed in the route table or chosen display, where available, along the route itself.\n• Adjust waypoints. Once the entire route is planned on small scale charts, return to the start position and conduct a more accurate planning by fine-tuning the waypoints, using appropriate large-scale charts. Place waypoints as accurately as possible.\n• Note\nA route planning software can be used to create and review optimum voyage routes. The software is integrated with chart management and ordering tools, overlays of NAVAREA warnings, etc.\n• Consider the following when adding or adjusting waypoints:\n  o Ship considerations:\n     Draft in relation to available depth and width of navigable water and minimum required UKC\n     Effect on ship’s draft and turning circle during course alteration:\n- Planned speed\n- ROT restrictions\n- Effect of expected tidal stream\n- Effect of expected current\n- Increase in draft due to squat and heel effect.\n     Optimal fuel efficiency.\n  o Route considerations:\n     Adequate XTC\n     Alterations of speed enroute\n     Avoidance of danger areas\n     Contingency/emergency planning:\n- Points of non-return\n- Place of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of an emergency\n- Shore-based emergency response arrangements and equipment.\n     Depth of water, Tidal restrictions\n     Limitations of night passage\n     Location of course alterations\n     Method and frequency of position verification\n     Piracy and security\n     Pilot station(s). Place a waypoint at the pilot station to ensure accurate ETA\n     Protection of the environment\n     Safe speed and proximity of navigational hazards\n     Territorial baselines\n     Use of ship’s routeing, reporting systems and VTS.\nNote\nBy default, ECDIS will create legs as rhumb lines, but for ocean passages this can be changed to a Great Circle line.\n• Plot specific details of T&P / EP NMs, navigational warnings, NAVTEX messages and local information as a manual layer and made alarmable by using the look-ahead feature to highlight the navigational hazards for the OOW. The manual layers must be displayed at least within 50 nm on either side of the planned track.\n• Define the ship’s safe speed for each leg of the planned route.\n• Apply any guidance or direction related to ship’s route as per the charterers orders.\n• Calculate the safety depths and safety contours and set them up in line with the UKC requirements (see Paragraph 13 ).\n• Set maximum acceptable cross track corridor (XTC) to each leg of a route (see Paragraph 13.9 ).\n• Define the look-ahead zone (see Paragraph 13.8)\n• Set parallel indexing where appropriate.\n• Define abort points, critical points and emergency anchorages.\n• Calculate the wheel-over positions with the applicable rate of turn.\n• Plot no-go areas.\n• Set ETA using the route planning tools. Be aware that if this is set incorrectly, it may affect tidal data, UKC calculations and time dependent information for the route.\n• Note\nWhen the ship regularly visits a certain Port or frequently transits an area, it is advantageous to keep the whole or part of the passage plan as it is. Unless changes are made to channels, navaids, etc. a planned passage is acceptable for future visits, taking into account the meteorological and tidal differences and that inward and outward passages may be different. Parts of the plans may have common features that can be used.\nIf reusing a previous passage plan, then recheck the route to confirm that it remains safe and no changes are necessary.\nCAUTION\nWhen planning, consider the following:\nOpen Sea\nOcean routeing charts showing ocean currents, winds, ice limits and load lines\nLoad line charts showing zones and seasonal periods ensure compliance with the IMO International Convention on Load Lines\nWeather routeing services (if applicable)\nThe use of gnomonic projection charts for plotting great circle routes, as appropriate\nOcean currents and their impact on ship speed and fuel consumption\nWeather conditions, including anticipated seasonal variations, e.g., heavy weather, tropical storms, ice and reduced visibility\nEnvironmental protection measures and requirements that may extend into an ocean route\nCoastal Waters\nThe importance of passing charted and other features at a safe distance\nAdvice in the sailing directions\nAvailable depth of water and tidal information contained in tide tables/stream atlases\nAvailability of visual and radar fixing opportunities\nShip’s routeing and reporting measures, as well as the availability of VTS\nThe reliability of the ship’s propulsion and steering system\nEnvironmental protection measures and requirements, including fuel changeover\nConfined / Pilotage Waters\nRecommended routes and channel information\nProcedures for pilotage, including pilot boarding points and means of embarkation\nLocal conditions, rules and restrictions on navigation\nReporting and communications procedures\nDetails of the prospective berth, tugs and/or anchorages\nContingency planning for unforeseen issues\n15.2.3.2 Route Supplementary Information\nInserting “anger highlights” using manual layers, ensures that the OOW is informed and reminded of potential dangers and actions to be taken at various points during the passage.\nThe quantity of additional information must be limited to that which is necessary to execute the route with safety and efficiency, although this will depend on industry best practices and:\n• The complexity of the plan\n• The environmental conditions\n• The proximity of dangers\n• The Master’s standing orders.\nNavigation Officer: Include the following additional info, as minimum, when applicable:\n• Parallel indexing, methods and frequency of position verification\n• Landfall targets and lights\n• Clearing lines and bearings\n• Transits, heading marks and"}], "multi_pass_extraction": true, "num_passes": 1, "ocr_used": false, "category": "N", "extraction_warning": "Missing 56 sections"}}

The goal is to minimize impact\nand return systems to normal working order as soon as possible.\nResponding to a cyber incident may however be beyond the competencies held within the\nCompany and onboard the ships. In such cases, external expert assistance is required to\nensure an effective response.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the actions in response to the type of cyber incidents,\nwhich should be addressed in contingency plans onboard:\n•\tLoss of availability of electronic navigational equipment or loss of integrity of\nnavigation related data\n•\tLoss of availability or integrity of external data sources, including but not limited to\nGNSS\n•\tLoss of essential connectivity with the shore, including but not limited to the\navailability of Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS)\ncommunications\n•\tLoss of availability of industrial control systems, including propulsion, auxiliary\nsystems and other critical systems, as well as loss of integrity of data management\nand control\n•\tThe event of a ransomware or denial or service incident.\nThere are 4 phases to an incident response:\nPhase 1: Preparation\nThe Preparation phase covers the work the Company does to get ready for incident response,\nincluding establishing the right tools and resources and training the team.\nTo prepare for incidents:\n•\tCompile a list of IT/OT assets such as networks, servers and endpoints.\n•\tIdentify their importance and which ones are critical or hold sensitive data.\n•\tSet up monitoring such as:\n\to\tUser activity\n\to\tNetwork traffic\n\to\tInstalled software.\n•\tDetermine which types of security events should be investigated.\n•\tCreate detailed response steps for common types of incidents.\nPhase 2: Detection and Analysis\nDetection involves collecting data from IT/OT systems, security tools, publicly available\ninformation and people inside and outside the organization, and identifying precursors (signs\nthat an incident may happen in the future) and indicators (data showing that an attack has\nhappened or is happening now).\nAnalysis involves identifying a baseline of normal activity for the affected systems, correlating\nrelated events and seeing if and how they deviate from normal behavior.\nAscertain the following information:\n•\tHow the incident occurred?\n•\tWhich IT and/or OT systems were affected and how?\n•\tThe extent to which the commercial and/or operational data is affected.\n•\tTo what extend any threat to IT and OT systems remains?\nPhase 3: Containment, Eradication and Recovery\nContaining the outbreak of an incident is a time-critical exercise. The main goal of containment\nand eradication is the prompt limitation of the impact/damage and the prevention of any further\ndamage to the same or other constituent systems. This includes the following steps:\n•\tWhere possible, remove the system from the network. If it is not possible, then isolate\nthe infected system from its network and ensure that boundary controls are\noperational between networks.\n•\tCheck the firewall rules have not changed. Where systems are internet/VSAT facing, shut down remote access ports.\n•\tEnsure that anti-virus and anti-malware definitions are up to date.\n•\tTake a full disk/RAM image of any infected system for forensic investigation.\nThe purpose of recovery is to bring all affected systems back in normal operation.\nIT, OT Systems and data are cleaned, recovered and restored to an operational condition.\nNew PCs or equipment must be purchased if the incident is severe enough to necessitate this.\nRecovery plans for each system are covered in the next section.\nPhase 4: Post Incident Activity\nThis phase helps to evaluate the reason of the incident outbreak, the missed precursors and\nnew indications that must be added to the procedures for earlier detection and/or prevention:\n•\tInvestigate the incident: To understand the causes and consequences of a cyber\nincident, the Company must undertake an investigation by completing the form NCR\n003 “Incident Investigation Report” from Chapter 9 to report the cybersecurity\nincident. If the ship’s Flag has a specific form for cyber incident reporting, it must also\nbe used supplementary. The information from the incident investigation is significant\nfor preventing a potential reoccurrence.\n•\tPrevent re-occurrence: Taking into account the outcome of the investigation,\nactions to address any inadequacies in technical and/or procedural protection,\nmeasures are considered, in accordance with the Company procedures, for\nimplementation of corrective actions.\n•\tLessons Learnt: An essential part of following up a cyber security incident is to\ndocument, communicate and build on lessons learnt.
