Confined / Restricted Waters: When transiting in areas of shallow waters having limited room to navigate due to physical and/or legal restrictions, as a consequence, the Master and/or the OOW cannot choose the ship’s route freely. There is no rigid distinction between coastal and confined waters, and the limits of those are to be set by the Master and the navigation officer during the passage planning stage. Examples of “confined / restricted” waters are canals, lock systems, rivers leading to a port, confined areas among islands and reefs, waterways, traffic separation schemes, fairways, bays, harbors, and port approaches. Port approaches, channels, fairways: When transiting in shallow water areas with limited room to navigate within the jurisdiction of a port authority (e.g., confined or pilotage waters).

Sea passage is the phase of a voyage between the seaward limits of pilotage waters at the ports or places of departure and destination, usually denoted by “Full Away on Passage” and “End of Sea Passage” entries in the Bridge Log Book. OOW: Inform the E/R, as per the ship / passage’s needs, and always do so in no less than 2 hours. Ship’s Position Verification The Global Navigational Satellite System (e.g., GPS) is the standard source of position data for ECDIS. The managed ships use a combination of various methods at regular intervals to verify the ship’s position. Refer to the ECDIS Manual, paragraph 14, for the procedures related to position cross-checking. Voyage It is the ship's journey from departing the discharge port in ballast condition until the end of the unloading operation at the discharging port, including the time required to load or unload the ship. Ship’s Time Navigation Officer: Keep the ship's clocks on local time or zone time, except for the GMDSS clock, which is always set on UTC. Use the 24-hour format (00:00 to 24:00) for time recording. Unless otherwise instructed, use the hh:mm LT (i.e., 19:30 LT) format in all forms/records. Ship’s Safe Speed-Relative Speed Master / OOW: Maintain speed appropriate to prevailing traffic, navigational hazard proximity, and weather conditions. Adjust speed to allow for proper and effective action to avoid collision and/or stop the ship within a safe distance. Relative speed, as the speed log indicates, is the speed through the water (STW). It can differ from the ship’s speed over the ground (SOG) due to the effect of water currents and winds on the ship’s hull. Comply with national regulations regarding ship’s speed. Deep draught ships (with draught 15 m or more) navigating in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore shall, as far as safe and practicable, proceed at a speed of no more than 12 knots over the ground in the following areas: a) At One Fathom Bank traffic separation scheme, b) Deep-water routes in Phillip Channel and Singapore Strait, c) Westbound lanes between 01°12·51’N, 103°52·15’E and 01°11·59’N, 103°50·21’E and between 01°11·13’N 103°49·08’E and 01°08·65’N, 103°44·30’E. Daily Noon Position, Arrival or Departure Reporting Master: Prepare and send arrival and departure reports and position reports to the office daily at noon while the ship is sailing. These reports regularly inform the Company of the position and basic parameters of the ship and the voyage. See samples of daily noon, arrival, and departure messages in Chapter 7.8. Standby Engines Master / OOW: Order Engine on \\\"standby\\\" at any time during the voyage, informing the E/R promptly. Record the times in the Bridge Log Book when the machinery space is on standby for maneuvering. OOEW: Engineers must be ready to respond immediately to any engine orders. The ship shall be placed on stand-by under the following conditions, but not limited to: In high traffic density areas (see paragraph 7.2.4.15.3 of this Chapter) When navigating near navigational hazards In adverse weather conditions When navigating in restricted visibility When navigating in ice When in coastal or shallow waters When in confined or restricted waters, canals or river passages When in pilotage waters, including pilot embarkation and disembarkation When navigating in Security Risk Areas During the port approach, entry, or departure During mooring, towing and anchoring operations In OPL calls During ship / helicopter operation During distress assistance During stores or personnel transfers underway At any time that the Master considers that the ship's safety, security, or maneuverability is jeopardized. RPM Posting Navigation Officer: Consult the table of correspondence of the engine’s rpm with the telegraph order and the expected ship speed in laden or ballast condition. Post the table on the bridge near the engine telegraph position. Use the values provided from the above correspondence during the passage planning. Record changes on the engine’s telegraph (e.g., from FA to STBY) in the Bridge Log Book. Maneuvering Characteristics Master / Navigation Officer: Use the wheelhouse poster and booklet to become familiar with the ship’s maneuvering characteristics and to obtain values of its maneuvering performance for passage planning. Be aware that the ship’s maneuvering performance may differ between the poster and the booklet due to environmental, hull, and loading conditions. Ensure that the maneuvering booklet and the wheelhouse poster: Are including that the ship’s power has been limited to meet EEXI requirements and state the limiting power for the attention of the Master to account for the ship’s performance so caused in case no corresponding trials are carried out.

Do not forget to look out of the window. Make a full appraisal of the situation and the risk of collision. A full appraisal of the risk of collision means understanding the other ship's closest point of approach (CPA) and the time to the closest point of approach (TCPA), as well as whether she is passing to port or starboard or crossing ahead or astern. Take positive action in ample time to avoid collision in accordance with COLREGs. The action to avoid collision with another vessel must result in passing at a safe distance (see the Company’s min.

Knowing the overhead clearance when passing an overhead object is vital when the ship plans to pass it. Overhead Clearance (OHC) is the distance between the highest point of the ship and the lowest point of any bridge, cable, or other overhead obstruction. Master / OOW: Consider the following factors affecting the Overhead Clearance: Ship’s air draft as measured from the baseline (keel) Ship dynamic draft Effect of trim / Tidal height / water level Movements in sea and swell. Provide allowance for the ship’s steering performance and drift angle in case of bridges with a maximum clearance in the centerline. Assess the ship’s steering performance when crossing a bridge with the highest point positioned in a narrow section. Adjust the heading to maintain course when the currents and/or the wind affect the ship while passing under an overhead obstruction. Consider the charterers' voyage orders and the relevant Charter Party. Consider the risk of an electrical discharge between the ship and the power line. Consider that the center of a channel IS NOT always the lowest part of a power line. The Overhead Clearance (OHC) policy is stated below: When making a RA to decide on a safe OHC, consider the following factors: Clearance according to chart and authorities, air draft of the ship, tidal height Width of the overhead clearance Steering performance and leeway Ship’s movement in the sea and swell Reliability of all data used in the calculation Voltage, the risk of electrical discharge when passing under power cables On rare occasions, there is lower clearance due to heavy ice build-up on the power cables. The calculation of the Air Draft requires: Calculation of the distance between the frames of the aft draft scale and the frame in the main mast’s position. Use frame spacing in the General Arrangement Plan. Calculation of the distance between the keel and masthead (or antenna at the highest point). The distance (in meters) is indicated in the General Arrangement Plan; however, check for any modifications made throughout the ship's life. Calculation of the tide height (in meters) for the time of passing under the overhead obstruction obtained either optimally from the Tide Tables (ATT) or local authorities (written information). Calculation of height correction due to trim (if applicable). The above data defines the Air Draft (form N 005).

Static draft is the distance between sea level (referenced in the chart datum) and the lowest level of the ship’s keel. Dynamic draft is the ship draft when it is subject to squat, sea, and swell influences and increases the draft due to heel when turning/rolling or trim when pitching. Gross UKC is calculated by subtracting the ship's static draft from the water available (depth and tide). Minimum Dynamic UKC Policy The Company has set the below minimum dynamic UKC policy. Sheltered waters are water bodies with shorelines that are not subject to the direct action of undiminished ocean waves. Static UKC is the clearance for a ship in still water (i.e., Static UKC = Sea Depth – Ship Draft + HoT) Master / OOW: Use form N 005 for UKC calculations: The drafts in the above table refer to prevailing water density at the specific location. If in doubt of the actual water density, assume the freshwater draft to err toward safety. Plan voyages to avoid, wherever practical, transiting areas where the UKC is less than double the ship’s maximum static draft. When there is a combination of any of the above cases, the stricter policy applies. Factors to be Considered when Calculating and Evaluating the UKC The UKC policy applies to the dynamic condition of the ship, where the below variables are applied to the static draft: The effect of squat based on the ship’s speed through the water. The location of the ship: open waters or confined waters. Environmental conditions such as water density, prevailing weather, height of swell, tidal height and range, atmospheric pressure, local anomalies, and current. The nature and stability of the bottom (e.g., sand wave phenomena, silting). Reduced depths over pipelines or any other obstructions. The ship’s size and handling characteristics and how the ship squats, whether by head or stern. The reliability of the ship’s draft observations and calculations, including estimates of hogging or sagging. Increase in draft due to heel when turning/rolling. Wave response allowance, which is the vertical displacement of the hull due to heave, roll, and pitch motions. The accuracy/reliability of hydrographic data. This is generally described on tabulated source diagrams or as “Zones of Confidence” and considers how the depths were obtained originally, i.e., via hand leads or sophisticated survey methods (see ECDIS manual, paragraph 11.1). The accuracy of tidal predictions. The ocean-atmosphere interaction and the horizontal gradient of atmospheric pressure can both increase the level due to the stacking of water on the coast and reduce it due to the withdrawal of water by local or synoptic phenomena, such as wind speed and direction and/or high or low barometric pressure. Consideration of CATZOC in UKC Calculations UKC calculations must address ZOC uncertainty. Considering the minimum UKC policy and the ZOC uncertainty, either of the following 2 outcomes will apply: The UKC required is greater or equal to the ZOC uncertainty: no additional measures are needed. The UKC required is less than the ZOC uncertainty: then the Master must advise the Marine/Operations Department, request additional information for the port to assess the risk through a RA, and decide on proceeding, considering that the uncertainty is larger than the remaining safety margin. Master / OOW: Additionally, when planning to sail in areas where the ZOC is C, D, or U and the calculated dynamic UKC is less than 3,5 m.: Conduct a RA examining the possible hazards. Advise the Marine / Operations Department on the RA’s outcomes and request written approval. Review the sailing directions recommended route for the particular passage. Check for regular shipping lanes for the voyage. Consider previously used routes. Verify that the course is plotted in areas with dense spot soundings. Ask local authorities/agents for the latest details about draft restrictions and: Date of most recent dredging Maximum allowed arrival / departure draft Most recent deepest arrival / departure draft (arrival and safe berthing of ships of similar size and draft establishes a degree of safety for the transit under prevailing environmental conditions) Expected movement of traffic in the area Controlled transit speed. Actions when UKC Policy Requirements cannot be met The Master may be unable to meet the Company’s UKC requirements, for instance, when: Voyage orders specify a draft or a cargo nomination that would result in a UKC less than the minimum required. Local regulations or recommendations by relevant authorities provide for a UKC less than the minimum required. The Risk Assessment must consider the following: Local survey information received from port authorities or other reliable sources such as terminal operators and pilots: The actual depth of Berth / Loading / Discharging Areas The maximum permitted draft The tidal data that may differ due to local anomalies The characteristics of the port / berth area, including the nature of the sea bottom. Latest and most accurate data, utilizing the latest editions of properly corrected charts and publications: Water depth in terminal approaches at low water Expected tide Water depth in berth at low water Sufficient UKC and safe OHC, when applicable. Common practice and good seamanship: Frequently sound around the ship shortly after arrival when conditions permit. Record soundings in the Bridge Log Book. Monitor the indications of the echo sounder frequently and at critical points. Check the water density of the port upon arrival, and if the port is subject to water density changes due to tidal factors, also check at the high and low water phases. Monitor the ship’s trim and draft. Ensure enough UKC exists throughout the voyage, at anchorage, and alongside. Evacuate the berth if at any risk of grounding. Operation matters connected to the prevailing environmental conditions: Berthing / unberthing times Expected commencement / completion of cargo operation. Previous experience / records for the specific port / berth areas. Communication of the UKC Calculations Master: Present the passage plan to the pilot and the UKC calculation of the transit. Bring to the pilot's attention the transits through shallow waters and discuss the ship’s dynamic UKC in detail. Maintain a record of information exchange in the form N 014. Provide the office with the passage plan and UKC calculations upon request. Inform the office immediately if the required UKC cannot be maintained throughout the planned voyage. Inform the agent and the port authorities about the minimum calculated UKC as part of the ship’s clearance process. Advise the charterers of the minimum calculated UKC (if necessary) as obliged by the relevant charter party. Report the ship's UKC to any third party (port control, VTS) as part of a voluntary or mandatory reporting system. Safety Settings Affected by the Dynamic UKC Calculation These are the following: Safety contour - Safety depth, and Echo sounder alarm. Updating UKC Calculations OOW: Update the UKC calculations to reflect: The new predicted time of passing over critical hydrographic features where the passage is delayed for more than 2 hours. The actual speed, when the speed used for calculation, was exceeded by more than 10% when passing the critical hydrographic feature.

Have readily available the email received from the Authority indicating the safe draft.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Squat\",\n      \"content\": \"Squat is the loss in UKC as a ship moves after being at rest. The squat comprises mean bodily sinkage and the trim ratio (forward or aft). It can be caused in 2 ways: On most occasions, squat is caused by the ship's forward motion. As the ship moves forward, she develops a mean bodily sinkage and a slight trimming effect. The ship’s bodily sinkage and the trim ratio (forward and aft) are known as ship squat. The other occasion where squat will occur is with a moored ship alongside a jetty in an ebb tide. Tide speed along the stationary ship produces, as before, components of bodily sinkage and trimming effects. The 2 combined account for ship squat for stationary ship. Shallow Water Indications A ship behaves differently in shallow water than in deep water. When entering shallow waters: The ship’s resistance will increase Speed will be reduced despite the same input of engine power Propeller revolutions will be reduced The squat will be increased Wave making increases at the forward end of the ship Ship becomes more sluggish to maneuver Ship may start to vibrate suddenly because of entrained water effects causing resonance Rolling, pitching, and heaving motions decrease due to the cushion of water under the ship. Factors Affecting Ship Squat The main factors affecting the ship’s squat are: The forward speed, which is the speed of the ship through the water (STW). This is the most important factor because ship squat varies directly as the square of forward speed. If the speed is halved, the squat is quartered. The block co-efficient (Cb). The relationship between the water depth (H) and the static mean draft of the ship (T). As H/T decreases, squats increase. The presence of river or canal banks. The closer banks are to the sides of a moving ship, the greater the squats will be. The presence of nearby ships in a crossing or passing maneuver increases squats on both ships. Practical Calculations for Squat OOW: Use the following methods for calculating the approximate squats (form N 005) when in open or confined waters: Maximum Squat = (CB x S0.81 x V2.08) / 20 (in meters) CB: Block Co-Efficient; S: Blockage Factor = (b x T) / (B x H); V: Ship Speed Relative to the Water or Current, b: Breadth of Ship, T: Ship’s Static Draft; B: Breadth of River or Canal; H: Depth of Water When the ship is in open water, the formula for B becomes B = (7.04 / CB0.85) x b. Effect of the Squat on Ship’s Draft It is imperative to know when maximum squat may occur. Maximum squat depends on how a ship is trimming when static. When the ship is even keel while stationary (trim is zero). Trim by the head if the CB is greater than 0,700 Trim by stern if the CB is less than 0,700 Usually not trim if CB is 0,700. The squat will consist only of the mean bodily sinkage component. When the ship is trimming while stationary, then the following applies: If the ship is static and trimming by the head, then when underway, bodily sinkage will occur, plus a slight trimming effect by the head. If the ship is static and trimming by the stern, then when underway, bodily sinkage will occur, plus a slight trimming effect by the stern. Prevention of Squat and its effects Master / OOW: To prevent excessive squat and its effects, consider the following: Reducing speed. Increasing the H/T value (where H is the depth of water and (T) is the static mean draft of the ship). This can be achieved by deballasting or moving into deeper water. Reduce the CB value by reducing the static mean draft. The CB at a lower draft will reduce the squat value. Communicating the Squat Calculation Master / OOW: Communicate the squat values to: Shipboard personnel: bridge team members must be aware of possible dangers from excessive squat. Pilot(s): they need a detailed appreciation of the squat. Any third party needing to know about the ship’s squat, like port authorities.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Wave Response Allowance\",\n      \"content\": \"It is the vertical displacement of the hull due to heave, roll, and pitch motions. They are short-period oscillatory changes in water level, with wavelengths generally shorter than the ship's length. The lowest point in the water that any part of the ship's hull reaches contributes to the maximum draft. The heave (vertical motion of the entire hull), the pitch (the angular motion of the bow and stern in opposite directions), and the roll (the angular motion of the port and starboard sides of the ship in opposite directions) all can contribute to the maximum draft. The effect of waves on the ship depends on the hull shape, water depth, seabed profile, and wave size. The maximum vertical and rolling motions of waves are often uncertain.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Interaction\",\n      \"content\": \"Interaction is the resultant effect of positive and negative forces around the ship’s hull when meeting another ship or obstruction, which is manifested in different ways, from involuntary changes of speed to unexpected changes of course, draft, or trim, and can lead to collision or grounding. Situations in which interaction is involved: Ships attempting to pass at very close range (overtaking or head-on encounter). Ships maneuvering in a close distance for operational reasons, particularly when the larger ship has a small UKC. Ships with a small UKC, which stop rapidly when approaching an enclosed basin, resulting in unexpected sheering. This includes the reduced effect of accompanying tugs, which may sometimes occur in these circumstances. Interaction can cause one or more of the following situations: If two ships are passing or overtaking in a river, the squats of both ships could be significantly increased, even doubled, when both amidships are directly in line. They will also develop an angle of heel, and the smaller ship will be drawn towards the larger ship. Both ships could lose steerage efficiency and alter course without a change in rudder helm. The smaller ship may suddenly veer off course and head into the adjacent riverbank or the larger ship. In other words, there is a ship to ground interaction, a ship-to-ship interaction, and a ship to shore interaction. Master: Examine the depth contours and channel dimensions during the passage planning stage to identify areas where interaction may occur. Stay alert and try to decrease the effects of interaction by: Maximizing distance from other ships. Reducing speed. Using the rudder to counteract yawing effects by nearby ships or riverbanks. Maintaining the effectiveness of the rudder, e.g., proceed with a momentary increase of propeller revolutions when going ahead to improve the ship’s control.

A decreased distance between the ship and the bank: Tends the ship’s bow away from the bank (bow cushion) and moves the stern towards the bank (bank suction). Influences maneuvering performance considerably. Decreases steering capability. Increases ship speed. Master: Prevent grounding by: Keeping the ship in the fairway’s center or as far away from the bank as possible. Using the correct rudder helm. Reducing speed.

In cases of engine breakdown, the ship will drift because of the winds towards the shore. Master: You can reduce the distances described above, always considering the safety of navigation, international and local regulations, and environmental conditions. Reflect every such change in the passage plan and inform all navigating officers through your daily orders.

In both clear and restricted visibility, it provides: Means to continuously monitor the ship’s position in coastal areas along the planned track, even when other methods of position verification are unavailable. Means to locate other traffic objects around own ship. When combined with an ARPA, the functionality of RADAR can be further enhanced. ARPA is an automatic tool for systematically plotting detected objects, as required by the COLREGs. It offers several automated collision avoidance features, including trial maneuvers before initiating actions. Master / OOW: When using the RADAR for navigation, position verification, and collision avoidance: Review the operating manuals for all RADAR models onboard and be familiar with their capabilities and limitations. Use the RADAR unit(s) constantly. The working life of a RADAR will not be prolonged by switching it off. Use different RADAR range scales when 2 or more RADAR units are running. Use one RADAR for collision avoidance and one RADAR for navigation when 2 or more RADARs are running. Ensure that the range scale in use is appropriate to the prevailing circumstances. Use long range scanning periodically to detect targets and landfalls and when approaching high traffic areas. Operate the RADAR off center, when appropriate, for a better view ahead whilst maintaining the benefits provided by a smaller range scale. Check and adjust the brilliance, gain, tune, and clutter controls regularly to ensure they are optimized for the prevailing conditions. Adjust the manual clutter controls and use the automatic clutter controls regularly to ensure that targets are not being masked by the sea or rain clutter or by the anti-clutter feature. Ensure that the RADAR pulse length is optimized for the range scale in use: shorter pulse lengths for lower ranges and longer pulse lengths for higher ranges. Remember that long pulse lengths have poor range discrimination and may cause targets on the same bearing to merge if they are close to each other. Check the magnetron current at regular intervals (at least once every 4 hours) and verify that the values are within the maker’s limits. Replace the magnetron when the current indication is not within the specified limits or when the running hours are reaching the maker's limits. Record the running hours of each RADAR unit with remarks of satisfactory performance or a list of defects at least once every 4 hours in the RADAR Log Book. Ensure that any maintenance or repair on the RADARs is recorded in the RADAR Log Book to keep appropriate historical data for each unit. Check the alignment of the heading marker with the master gyro periodically, applying any gyro compass error to determine the true heading. Ensure that the heading marker is aligned with the ship’s fore and aft line by comparing the visual and RADAR relative bearings or a small but distinct target at the edge of the range scale in use. Do not attempt to align the heading marker with the berth while alongside. Frequently check the accuracy of the Electronic Bearing Line (EBL), Variable Range Marker (VRM), and the bearing cursor. Turn off the heading marker and range rings regularly to avoid obscuring small targets. Use parallel indexing techniques, whenever possible, to continuously compare the ship’s position to the pre-planned track in conjunction with other position verification methods. RADAR ranges are more accurate than RADAR bearings. For accurate position verification, couple RADAR ranges with visual bearings whenever possible. Bear in mind that RADAR beamwidth distortion may stretch the ends of headlands and similar features causing errors in RADAR bearings. The effect of beamwidth distortion may be reduced temporarily by turning down the gain. Identify all RADAR targets before use for position verification. When taking over the watch, check and familiarize yourself with the settings of all RADARs in use, as they may have been changed by other operators. See Appendix V of this Chapter for guidelines related to RADAR’s features and modes of display. When using the ARPA, consider the following: Review the operating manuals - be familiar with their capabilities and limitations. Use different vectors and trail types when multiple ARPA are in operation, as a comprehensive display of all information regarding traffic in the vicinity is readily available. Remember that the GPS speed is the ship’s SOG. Frequently check the compass heading, the positional feeds, and the speed inputs, as they may produce inaccurate target true vector data, particularly when another ship is on or near a reciprocal course. This may lead to an incorrect identification of the other ship’s true heading and the necessary collision avoidance action. Bear in mind that the relative motion of a target, and therefore its CPA, TCPA, and Bow Crossing Range (BCR), should remain the same regardless of RADAR set-up, provided the ship and the target maintain their course and speed. Ensure that CPA, TCPA, and BCR alarms are switched on and adjusted according to the prevailing navigational situation (see paragraph 7.2.1.6). To obtain accurate target information, an ARPA must track it for at least 3 minutes. Select a vector length appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. Be familiar with the use of the ARPA trial function, and practice its use when the navigational situation allows. Trial Maneuver is one of the ARPA features implemented in the Advanced Tactical Display (ATD) system and is used for collision avoidance. Trial Maneuver simulates the effect of the ship’s maneuver on all tracked targets with or without time delay. While the Trial Maneuver is switched ON, actual target tracking continues uninterrupted in the background.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Closest Point of Approach (CPA) / TCPA and Bow Crossing Range (BCR)\",\n      \"content\": \"To ensure a sufficient safety distance for collision avoidance in case of any unforeseen situation, such as steering/engine failure, the Company has set the below minimum CPA / TCPA and BCR policy: Master: Increase the CPA / TCPA and BCR limits according to prevailing conditions and your judgment.

PI is the most effective way of continuously monitoring a ship's progress in restricted waters, can be used in any situation where a RADAR-conspicuous navigation mark is available and it is practicable to monitor continuously the ship's position relative to such an object. The PI technique must be used, in conjunction with a good visual lookout and other navigational aids available, to provide the Master and the OOW with critical navigational information and the position of the ship. The basic principle of PI Plotting can be applied to either: A stabilized relative motion display or A ground-stabilized true-motion display. On a stabilized relative motion display, the echo of a fixed object will move across the display in a direction that is the exact reciprocal of the course made good by the ship at a speed commensurate to its speed over the ground. A line drawn from the echo of the fixed object tangential to the variable range marker circle set to the desired passing distance will indicate the forecast track of the echo as the ship proceeds. If the bearing cursor is set parallel to this track, it will indicate the course to make good for your ship. Any displacement of the echo from the forecast track will indicate a departure of own ship from the desired course over the ground. On a ground-stabilized true-motion display, the echo of a fixed object will remain stationary on the display, and the origin of the display (own ship) will move along the course made good by the ship at a speed commensurate to its speed over the ground. A line should be drawn from the echo of the fixed object tangential to the variable range marker circle set to the desired passing distance. If the electronic bearing marker is set parallel to this line it will indicate the course to be made good by own ship over the ground. Any departure of the ship’s course will be indicated by the drawn line not being tangential to the variable range marker circle. (The variable range marker circle should move along the line like a ball rolling along a straight edge). Master / OOW: Practice the Parallel Indexing on the RADAR display in clear weather during straightforward passages, and become familiar with this technique before attempting it in difficult passages, at night, or in restricted visibility.

To return the rudder to amidships, press the NFU tiller to the opposite side of the initial movement and keep pressed till the rudder is amidships.

The auto pilot steers the manually input course by controlling the steering gear to turn the rudder in the required manner but cannot compensate for the effects of wind and tidal-stream / current on the ship’s course over the ground (COG). Use the auto pilot mode when the conditions for manual steering do not exist, usually in open seas. Consider the following while operating the auto pilot system: The Rudder Limit specifies the maximum degree of the rudder the auto pilot is allowed to use for correcting or counteracting. This is set to suit the requirements related to the ship’s maneuvering characteristics, available sea room, traffic conditions, ship loading conditions, and prevailing weather conditions. The rudder limit must never exceed 200 at ballast conditions and 100 when laden. Rate of Turn (RoT) – when altering course, the rudder will move as needed to attain the required turn rate without exceeding the set value. This control specifies the maximum degree of turn rate allowed, related to the ship’s maneuvering characteristics, the available sea room, traffic conditions, ship loading conditions, and prevailing weather conditions. The rate of turn limit must never exceed 100 per minute. Speed – determines the effectiveness of the rudder. Auto pilot use is prohibited when the ship is maneuvering or steaming at low speeds, less than 6 knots. The auto pilot system receives feeds of the ship’s speed either from the speed log or the GPS. OOW: Check at intervals of at least every four hours that the sensors receive the correct speed values; otherwise, any error will be reflected in the auto pilot system. Set the speed input manually when the feeds from the sensors are not accurate. Steering Gear Pumps pump hydraulic oil to actuate the steering gear unit (RAM), which moves the rudder in the required direction. The more pumps are running, the faster the rudder will move. OOW: Be aware of the pumps and use them carefully. Rotate the steering gear pumps every month to ensure uniform wear. Weather Conditions (Yaw) – rough weather and hostile sea conditions hinder the autopilot’s performance. Proper yaw control settings facilitate the ship’s course-keeping ability. Higher values must be set in bad weather with strong winds compared to fair weather conditions. Gyro Compass – the autopilot system is functionally dependent on the Gyro Compass.

Integrity: a system’s capacity to provide a threshold of confidence and, in the event of an anomaly in the positioning data, an alarm. Continuity: a system’s ability to function uninterrupted. Availability: how often a signal fulfils the above accuracy, integrity, and continuity criteria. The antenna offset data contains the horizontal distance (X) from reference position to the antenna position, the forward distance (Y) from reference position to the antenna position and the height (Z) from ship bottom to the antenna unit. Some common GNSS errors are: Dilution of Precision error (DOP) - DOP values highly depend on the number of available satellites and their position in the celestial dome. If the number of tracked satellites increases, then the quality precision of the obtained position usually improves, and so the DOP values will decrease, giving a better resolution and narrower error. Receivers Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a diagnostic function that tests the accuracy of GPS signals. To use the RAIM function the OOW has to enter the range (from own ship in meters) for which the position confidence is required (e.g., 100 m). The receiver estimates position confidence using range value and detected satellite error, and displays the results as one of 3 levels of position confidence. The 3 levels are as follows: GNSS Jamming and Spoofing – Jamming is usually caused by interference to the signals at GNSS frequencies, while spoofing attack attempts to deceive a GNSS receiver by broadcasting incorrect GNSS signals, structured to resemble a set of normal GNSS signals, or by rebroadcasting genuine signals captured elsewhere or at a different time. Multi Path error - Multipath interference occurs when the GNSS receives reflected signals in addition to the direct LOS signal. These interference signals (noise signals) are generally reflected from the ground and the ship structure. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio of the signal to noise power and is routinely measured by GNSS receivers to indicate the signal strength of the received satellite signal and the noise density (i.e., the antenna and receiver noise temperature). To extract the information safely from the signal, the useful signal must stand out clearly from background noise, so the SNR must be sufficiently large. A ratio of more than 1:1 (more than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"GNSS Receiver (Single or Multiple) Failure\",\n      \"content\": \"Frequency of Position Fixing when GNSS Receiver(s) Fails OOW: When the GNSS receivers cannot provide accurate position fixing, use other methods in intervals specified below.

Perpendicularity error. If the index glass is not perpendicular to the plane of the sextant, readings will be inaccurate. Check by clamping the index bar at the middle of its arc and holding the sextant horizontally. Then, with the arc away from you, look obliquely into the index mirror to see the graduated arc and its reflection. If the arc and its reflection appear continuous, there is no error of perpendicularity. If there is a step, there is an error, and you need to adjust the screw on the index mirror until the arc and its reflection appear continuous. Side error. This occurs when the horizon mirror isn't perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. Aim the instrument at the horizon to detect this and tilt your head to the right by 45o. If a side error is present, the horizon won't appear continuous in its reflection — there will be a step. To correct this, adjust the side error screw until the horizon and its reflection appear in line. Next, return your head to an upright position. If the side errors are eliminated, the horizon will remain in line with its reflection. If not, you may need to correct for index error. You may need to adjust both several times before all errors are eliminated. Index error. If the horizon mirror is not parallel to the index mirror, this results in an index error. To check for this, set the index arm at 0o and aim the instrument at the horizon. When you look through, the reflection and image of the horizon must be a straight line. If they aren't, adjust the micrometer drum until they are and note the measurement it gives. This will provide your index error. If the error is on the arc, subtract this number from your readings, and if it's off the arc, you should add it. Non-adjustable errors caused by manufacturing defects or mishandling.

Do not over-rely on calculated CPAs and TCPAs from ARPA. Consider navigational constraints, environmental factors, and the ship’s maneuverability. Take timely preventive action if a close quarters situation is developing and/or collision risk exists, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, the following are avoided as far as possible: An alteration of course to port for a ship forward of the beam, other than for a ship being overtaken (COLREG Rule 19d(i)). An alteration of course towards a ship abeam or abaft the beam (COLREG Rule 19d(ii)). Reduce ship speed to the minimum, which can maintain course when: A fog signal from another ship was heard, apparently forward of the ship’s beam A close-quarters situation with another ship forward of the ship’s beam cannot be avoided. Ensure that the following COLREG Rules are always implemented: Rule 7 on risk of collision: there is a risk of collision if you are in any doubt.

When sailing in heavy weather conditions, a ship may encounter various dangerous phenomena, which can lead to capsizing or severe roll motions jeopardizing cargo, equipment, and persons onboard. The sensitivity of a ship to these phenomena will depend on its stability parameters, hull geometry, ship size, and speed. This implies that the vulnerability to dangerous responses, including capsizing, and its probability of occurrence in a particular sea state may differ for each ship. Master / Con: Reduce speed/alter course, if necessary, in heavy weather if excessive rolling, propeller emergence, water on deck, or heavy slamming occurs. When deciding on appropriate course and speed in adverse weather conditions, consider the following: capsizing, heavy rolling with the risk of damage, damage through slamming, longitudinal or torsional stresses, effects of waves in shallow water or current, and risk of collision or stranding. Engage manual steering and adjust the bridge watch category according to the bridge manning matrix in paragraph 7.2.4.2. Ascertain that ship complies with the criteria of the Intact Stability Code.

A ship sailing in following or stern quartering seas encounters waves with a longer period than in beam, head, or bow waves, and the principal dangers caused in such a situation are as follows: Surf-riding and broaching-to: When a ship is situated on the steep forefront of a high wave in following or quartering sea conditions, it can accelerate to ride on the wave. This is known as surf-riding. In this situation the so-called broaching-to phenomenon may occur, which endangers the ship to capsizing due to a sudden change of the ship’s heading and unexpected large heeling. Reduction of intact stability when riding a wave crest amidships: When a ship is riding on the wave crest, intact stability can decrease according to changes in the submerged hull form. Particularly for wave lengths within the range of 0.6-2.3 L (L is the ship’s length), the stability reduction is nearly proportional to wave height. This situation is dangerous in following and quartering seas because of the increased duration of riding on the wave crest and therefore reduced stability. Synchronous rolling motion. Large rolling motions may occur when the natural rolling period of a ship coincides with the encounter wave period. In following and quartering seas, this may happen when the transverse stability of the ship is marginal and the natural roll period is extended. Parametric roll motions. Parametric roll motions with large and dangerous roll amplitudes in waves are due to the variation of stability between the position on the wave crest and the position in the wave trough. Parametric rolling may occur in 2 different situations: The stability varies with an encounter period TE that is about equal to the roll period TR of the ship (encounter ratio 1:1). The stability attains a minimum once during each roll period. This situation is characterized by asymmetric rolling, i.e., the amplitude with the wave crest amidships is much greater than the amplitude to the other side. Due to tendency of retarded up-righting from the large amplitude, this kind of parametric rolling may occur with a wide bandwidth of encounter periods. In quartering seas, a transition to harmonic resonance may be noticed. The stability varies with an encounter period TE that is approximately equal to half the roll period TR of ship (encounter ratio 1:0.5). The stability attains a minimum twice during each roll period. In following or quartering seas, this may only occur with very large roll periods, indicating marginal intact stability. The result is symmetric rolling with large amplitudes, with the tendency to adapt the ship response to the period of encounter due to reduction of stability on the wave crest. Parametric rolling with encounter ratio of 1:0.5 may also occur in head and bow seas. Other than in following or quartering seas, where the variation of stability is solely affected by the waves passing along the ship, the frequently heavy heaving and/or pitching in head or bow seas may magnify stability variation, in particular, due to the periodical immersion and emersion of the flared stern frames and bow flare of modern ships. This may lead to severe parametric roll motions even with small wave induced stability variations. The ship’s pitching and heaving periods are usually equal to the encounter period with the waves. How much the pitching motion contributes to the parametric roll motion depends on the timing (coupling) between the pitching and rolling motion. Combination of various dangerous phenomena. The dynamic behavior of a ship in following and quartering seas is complex. Ship motion is 3-dimensional and various detrimental factors or dangerous phenomena like additional heeling moments due to deck-edge submerging, water shipping and trapping on deck or cargo shift due to large roll motions may occur in combination with the above phenomena, simultaneously or consecutively. This may create dangerous combinations, which may cause ship capsize. Master: Perform ship handling as follows, to avoid dangerous situations when navigating in severe weather conditions: For Surf-riding and Broaching-to: Surf-riding and broaching-to may occur when the angle of encounter is in the range 135°<α<225° and the ship speed is higher than (1.8 √L) / cos (180−α) (knots). Take the speed, the course, or both outside the dangerous region reported in the following figure. For successive high-wave attacks: When the average wave length is larger than 0.8 L, and the significant wave height is larger than 0.04 L, and at the same time, some indices of the dangerous behavior of the ship can be clearly seen, do not enter the dangerous zone as per the next figure. When the ship is in this dangerous zone, reduce speed or change course to prevent successive attacks of high waves, which could induce risk due to reduced intact stability, synchronous rolling motions, parametric rolling motions, or a combination of various phenomena. The dangerous zone indicated in the next figure corresponds to conditions in which the encounter wave period (TE) is nearly double (i.e., about 1.8-3.0 times) the wave period (TW). Synchronous rolling and parametric rolling motions: Prevent synchronous rolling motion occurring when the encounter wave period TE is nearly equal to the natural rolling period of ship TR. To avoid parametric rolling in following, quartering, head, bow, or beam seas, select the course and speed in a way to avoid the encounter period being close to the roll period (TE = TR) or the encounter period being close to 1/2 of the ship roll period (TE = 0.5 x TR). The period of the encounter TE may be determined from the formula presented above. TW= wave period, ΤΕ= encounter period with waves, α = angle of encounter (α=0o in head sea, α= 90o for sea from starboard side), TR= natural period of roll of ship, L= Length between Perpendiculars.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Access to Main Deck during Heavy Weather\",\n      \"content\": \"No seafarers should be on deck in conditions that the Master considers adverse weather unless it is necessary for the safety of the ship, crew, or the safety of life at sea.

TRS are also known as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons, depending on their location. TRS originate in latitudes between 5° and 20° and travel between W and WNW in the Northern Hemisphere and between W and WSW in the Southern Hemisphere, at approximately 12 knots. Along their track, they curve away from the equator – curve to N and then recurve to NE in the Northern Hemisphere; curve to S and then recurve to SE in the Southern Hemisphere, causing it to travel around the oceanic high (situated at about 30°N and 30°S in the middle of large oceans). After recurving, the speed of travel increases to about 15 to 40 knots. Sometimes, a TRS does not curve or recurve at all but continues on its original path, crosses the coast, and dissipates quickly thereafter due to friction and lack of moisture. It is important to note that all TRSs do not follow such definite paths and speeds. In their initial stages, occasional storms can remain practically stationary or make small loops for as long as 4 days. Track - The route over which a TRS has already passed. Path -The predicted route over which there is a possibility of the TRS passing soon. Vertex - The westernmost point of the TRS when recurving takes place. Semi-circles: If a storm is split into 2 parts along the route: Right-hand semicircle (RHSC): It is the half of the storm on the right of an observer facing along the storm’s route. For a stationary observer, the wind veers steadily. Left-hand semicircle (LHSC): It is the half of the storm to the left of an observer facing along the route of the storm. For a stationary observer, the wind backs steadily. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), conditions on the right-hand side of the storm direction are more severe than those on the left-hand side. For that reason, in Northern Hemisphere (NH), RHSC is called the “dangerous semicircle”, and LHSC is called the “navigable semicircle”. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), the side of a storm to the right of the storm’s direction of movement (RHSC) is called a “navigable semicircle”, and the left side (LHSC) is called a “dangerous semicircle”. The signs and symptoms of TRS are as follows: Heavy and long swell from Cyclone center. Swell is usually the first indication of the storm center, hence an approaching TRS. Pressure will be much lower than normal. When barometric pressure falls below 5 MB than normal, considering other confirmation factors, the approach of TRS is confirmed. Cirrus clouds in bands or filaments aligned towards the direction of the storm center. At sunset, the cloud color will be dark red or copper. Clouds will be dense and heavy. Frequent lighting will occur. Availability of storm warnings from the local authority based on satellite pictures and observations from other ships. The warnings provide the position and pressure of the storm center and the probable direction of movement of the storm. Squalls increasing in frequency and intensity. The possibility of rain with violent torrential character. Sea waves are becoming heavy and dangerous. Shift of wind direction in accordance with the rotation of winds of cyclonic spin. Master: Frequently check weather reports when in latitudes where TRS may form. Be constantly alert to the indications of a TRS Take necessary actions when the approach of a TRS is confirmed: Obtain the bearing of the storm center: Face the wind, then the storm center will be within 100o to 125o on the right hand in the Northern Hemisphere (on the left hand in the Southern Hemisphere) – Buys Ballot’s Law. The direction of the swell roughly indicates the storm center. The direction of the densest part of the huge bank of clouds also indicates the storm center. If barometric pressure falls 5 MB below normal, then there is a possibility that the ship is in the well-developed outer storm area. If barometric pressure falls 20 MB or more below normal, then there is a possibility that the ship is near the eye of a well-developed TRS. Ascertain in which semi-circle the ship lies and take avoiding action: If you are in the northern hemisphere and the wind is veering (direction changes clockwise), you will likely be in the dangerous semicircle. Proceed with max. speed, keeping the wind at 10o to 45o on the starboard bow. The ship should turn to starboard as the wind veers. Where the wind direction is steady or back (direction changes counterclockwise), such that the ship is in the navigable semicircle, proceed at maximum speed while the wind is brought onto the starboard quarter. The ship should turn to port as the wind veers (Northern Hemisphere). If you are in the southern hemisphere and the wind is backing, the ship is likely to be in the dangerous semicircle and should proceed with maximum speed, keeping the wind 10o to 45o on the port bow. The ship should turn to port as the wind backs. If the wind direction is steady or backs, such that the ship is in the navigable semicircle, the wind should be brought well on the port quarter and the ship must proceed with max. speed. Turn to starboard as the wind backs (Southern Hemisphere). If the ship is in port when a TRS approaches and there is sufficient time to escape, it may be better to put out to sea than stay at the berth. Even with the best moorings, the ship is doubtful to be safe from the storm's effects.

Once the ship becomes trapped, she follows the ice. Ice navigation requires great patience and can be strenuous. The open waterway around a difficult ice area whose limits are known is often the fastest and safest way to the port or to the open sea when leaving a port. Master / OOW: Apply 4 basic ship handling rules when navigating on ice: Keep moving - even very slowly, but try to keep moving. Try to work with the ice movement and weaknesses but not against them. Avoid excessive speed, as it almost always results in ice damage. Know your ship’s maneuvering characteristics. Requirements when Navigating in Ice Master / C/E: Ensure the following before entering ice-covered waters: The propulsion plant and steering gear must be reliable and quickly responsive to maneuvering orders. The navigational and communications equipment must be equally reliable - maintain radar at peak performance. Ballast light and partly loaded ships as deeply as possible. Excessive trim by stern is not recommended, as it impedes maneuverability and increases the possibility of ice damage to the more vulnerable lower area of the exposed bow. E/R suction strainers must be able to be removed easily and kept clear of ice and snow. Good searchlights must be available to aid in visibility during night navigation with or without icebreaker support. Ships navigating in ice-covered waters may experience delays and, therefore, must carry sufficient fresh water, supplies, and maneuvering fuel. Signs of Ice in the Vicinity Master / OOW: When steaming through open water, the following signs may indicate ice in the vicinity: Ice blink, which is a reliable indication. It can usually be seen for some time before the ice is visible and appears as a luminous reflection on the underside of the clouds above the ice. The sighting of small fragments of ice often indicates that larger quantities are not far away. Abrupt moderation of the sea and swell occurs when approaching an ice field from leeward. The onset of fog often. On a clear day, abnormal light refraction may distort the appearance of features. Although the ice field will be seen at a greater distance than would normally be possible without refraction, its characteristics may be magnified out of all proportion—it may even appear as giant cliffs of ice in the far distance, with breaks between them where the open water lies. The following are signs of open water: Water sky: dark patches on low clouds, sometimes almost black in comparison with the clouds, indicate the presence of water below them. In clear air, this indication is less evident. When iceblink is visible at night, the absence of blink in some sectors of the horizon may indicate open water but cannot be assumed to be water sky. Dark spots in fog give a similar indication but are not visible for as great a distance as the reflection on clouds. A dark bank on a cloud at high altitudes indicates the presence of patches of open water below, which could lead to larger areas of open water in the immediate vicinity.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Entering the Ice without Ice-Breaker Escort\",\n      \"content\": \"Non-ice-class ships with an open water speed of about 12 knots can become hopelessly beset in heavy concentrations of relatively light ice conditions. Ice-class ships with adequate power can progress through first-year ice of heavy concentrations (e.g., 6/10 to 7/10) without any assistance other than routing advice. In ice concentrations of 6/10 or less, the ice-class ships can steer at slow speed around the floes in open pack ice without coming into contact with very many of them. The Company will always consider to engage the services of an Ice Navigator when applicable. Master / OOW: Do not enter ice if an alternative, although longer, open water route is available. Conduct a RA and brief the bridge team on the situation and relevant requirements. Do not underestimate the hardness of ice. Enter the ice at low speed to receive the initial impact; once into the pack, increase speed gradually to maintain headway and control of the ship, but do not let the speed increase beyond safe margins. Pay attention to applied power in areas of weak ice or open leads, pools, etc., where speed may dangerously increase unnoticed if power is not taken off. Be prepared to go \\\"Full Astern\\\" at any time. Do not attempt to navigate in pack ice after dark without high-power searchlights, which can be controlled easily from the bridge. If poor visibility precludes progress, heave to in the ice and keep the propeller turning slowly, as it is less susceptible to ice damage than if completely stopped. This prevents blocks of ice from jamming between blades and hull. Avoid going astern, where propellers and rudders are the most vulnerable parts. If required to go astern, do so carefully, and always with the rudder amidships. If required to ram ice when brought to a halt, do not go astern into unbroken ice but move astern only in the channel previously cut by their own passage. Give a wide berth to all forms of glacial ice (icebergs, bergy bits, growlers) in the pack, as they are current-driven, whereas the pack is wind-driven. Large features of old ice may be moving in a direction up-wind or across wind according to the direction of the current. Avoid, wherever possible, pressure ridges. Do not attempt to pass through pack ice under pressure. The ship may have to stop on the ice until the pressure event is over.

Inform the shore authority or the Ice Operation Center and the icebreaker of any change in the state of the ship while awaiting an icebreaker escort. Maintain close communications with the icebreaker while under escort, normally by radiotelephone on a selected and mutually agreed inter-ship VHF working frequency. Icebreaker Escort Operations Master / OOW: Maintain the required escort distance astern of the icebreaker to the best of the ship’s ability. The progress made depends greatly on the correct escort distance being maintained, which is dictated by the existing ice conditions and collision risk of overtaking the icebreaker. Notify the icebreaker immediately when the ship has stopped for any reason. If the ship is beset, the engines should be kept slow ahead to keep the ice away from the propellers. The engines must be stopped only when requested by the icebreaker.

The longer open water way around ice areas whose limits are known is often the fastest and safest way to port or to the open sea. Before Entering the Ice For an unstrengthened ship or for a ship whose structural capability does not match the prevailing ice conditions, it is preferable and safer to take any alternative, open water route around the ice even if considerably longer. Open water routes are always better than going through a large amount of ice. Any expected fuel savings will be more than offset by the risk of damage, and the actual fuel consumption may be higher by going through ice, even if the distance is shorter. Master / OOW: Consider the following before entering the ice field: Follow the recommended ice route provided either by relevant ice charts or ice service offices. Adjust the ship’s course accordingly if changes are recommended during passage. Post extra look-outs and increase bridge watch (see paragraph 7.2.4.2). Ensure sufficient light to complete the transit of the ice field in daylight or sufficient high-powered and reliable searchlights for use after dark. Minimize speed for initial impact with the ice. Carefully choose the ship’s entry into the ice field, preferably an area of lower ice concentration. The ship should enter the edge of the pack ice at the correct angles to avoid glancing blows. Brief the E/R personnel on the situation and what may be required of them, such as going astern at any time and frequent engine maneuvers and speed adjustments. Adjust the ballast down to the ice draft, if appropriate, or to such a draft that would offer protection to a bulbous bow, rudder, or propeller (as applicable). Ensure the main engine cooling water intake will never become clogged with slush ice. After Entering the Ice Master / OOW: Consider the following once the ship entered the ice field: Slowly increase speed according to prevailing ice conditions and the vulnerability of the ship. If visibility decreases while the ship is on the ice, reduce speed until the ship can be stopped within the distance of visibility. If in doubt, the ship must stop until visibility improves. The potential of damage by ice increases with less visibility. If the ship is stopped, keep the propeller(s) turning at low revolutions to prevent ice buildup around the stern. Use the pack to its best advantage. Follow open water patches and lighter ice areas, even if it initially involves large deviations from the course. Be aware following an open water lead at excessive speed, in limited visibility, it may be the trail of an iceberg. Do not allow the speed to increase to dangerous levels when in leads or open pools within an ice field or when navigating open pack conditions. Turning in Ice Changes in the course will be required in ice. If possible, carry out course changes in an area of open water or in relatively light ice, as turning in ice requires substantially more power than in water. Start turns early and make as wide an arc as possible to achieve the new heading. Master / OOW: Take care even when turning in an open water area. Do not underestimate the swing of the ship and make contact with ice on the ship's side or stern: a glancing blow with a soft piece of ice may result in the ship colliding with a harder piece. The ship will have a strong tendency to follow the path of least resistance and turning out of a channel may be difficult or impossible. Ships with twin propellers should use them to assist in turning. Consider, in very tight ice conditions, applying full power and leaving the rudder amidships. This allows ship to find the least resistance without any drag from the rudder in trying to maintain a straight course by steering. Decide what type of turning maneuver will be appropriate, if turning in an open water area is impossible. If the turn does not have to be sharp, it is best to maintain progress in ice with the helm over. Perform a star maneuver, when ice conditions are such that the ship's progress is marginal and the effect of drag of the rudder being turned may be sufficient to stop the ship. This maneuver is equivalent to turning the ship short round in ice by backing and filling with the engine and rudder. Assess the risk of backing in ice to accomplish the star maneuver, against any navigational dangers of a long turn in ice.

Use a short burst of power ahead to clear the ice, if ice starts building up under the stern. Using this technique of backing up to the ice and using the burst ahead to clear the ice can be very effective, but a careful watch must be kept of the distance between the stern and the ice edge.

Ice can be put under pressure in several ways. The most common situation occurs when open pack ice closes because of prevailing winds, but it may also occur when tides, currents, or on-shore breezes blow ice onto the shore. Be aware that the danger of becoming beset is increased greatly in the presence of old or glacial ice, as the pressure on the hull is that much greater. Check, when in pack ice, for any signs of the track closing behind the ship. Normally, there will be a slight closing from the release of pressure as the ship passes through the ice, but if the ice begins to close up completely behind the ship it is a strong sign that the pressure is increasing.

Go astern carefully to avoid ice going through the propeller(s), or if the ship frees itself, it does not make a sternway into any heavy ice. In ships with twin propellers, alternate them with one ahead and one astern for a few minutes, then change them to the opposite direction, slewing the stern from side to side to create a wider opening in the ice astern. Alternate the ballast to port and to starboard to list the ship and change the underwater shape. This method should only be done with knowledge of the possible consequences of an exaggerated list if the ship is quickly freed. Alternating the filling and emptying of the fore and after peak tanks is safer than using the ballast tanks but is usually only effective in changing the trim for the bow to get a better angle of attack on the ice ahead, or for the propellers to be given a better grip by greater submersion.

Always start with short rams to determine the thickness and hardness of the ice. Pay close attention to the ice conditions to prevent lodging the ship across a ridge on a large floe. Identify and avoid floes of old ice that may be distributed throughout the pack in northern waters. Undertake ramming with extreme caution because the impact forces caused when the ship contacts the ice can be very high. For ice-strengthened ships, these forces may be higher than those used to design the structure and may lead to damage.

When off-shore in deep water, the ship can safely stop in drift ice without anchoring when darkness or poor visibility prevents further progress. She will then drift with the ice and may be turned around by the ice, but will be safe if properly placed before shutting down. Berthing in ice-covered waters can be, and usually is, a long process. Master / OOW: Place, when approaching a berth in ice-covered waters, an officer on the bow to call back the distance off the wharf or pier, as variation in ice thickness (not observed from the bridge) can result in a sudden increase or decrease in the closing speed of the bow and the wharf.

The situation can be alleviated somewhat if there is an icebreaker making a track ahead of the towing icebreaker. Master / OOW: Avoid towing operations on ice without a properly trained and experienced crew. Towing in ice requires specialized skills and equipment. Ensure the towing equipment is robust and allows frequent changes in towline length. Use of shock absorbing springs or heavy surge chains. Bridle arrangements must optimize maneuverability to allow the ship and tow to navigate around heavy ridges and ice floes. Ensure the connection between ship and tug incorporates a weak link, usually a lighter pendant, which will fail before the tow-line or bridle. Ensure that, in difficult ice conditions, the towline is kept as short as possible to avoid having the towing wire pass under the ice floes due to the weight of the wire and the catenary formed by a longer line.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Speed\",\n      \"content\": \"Master / OOW: The force of impact varies as the square of the speed.

Close-range ice navigation is an interactive process that does not lend itself to traditional passage planning techniques. Two groups of equipment aid in close-range hazard detection: visual (searchlights and binoculars) and radar (both X- and S-band marine radars and the newer enhanced ice radar systems).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Use of RADAR for Ice Detection\",\n      \"content\": \"Master / OOW: Consider the following: RADAR can be a great asset in ice navigation in limited visibility, provided the display is properly interpreted. Ice makes a poor RADAR target beyond 3 to 4 nautical miles, and the best working scale is in the 2 to 3 nautical mile range. RADAR signal returns from all forms of ice (even icebergs) are much lower than from ship targets because of the lower reflectivity of RADAR energy from ice and snow. Detection of ice targets with low or smooth profiles is even harder on the RADAR screen, although the RADAR information may be decisive when attempting to identify the location of these targets under poor conditions, such as in high seas, fog, or in heavy snow return. Ice within 1 mile of, and attached to, the shore may appear on the RADAR display as part of the land itself. In order to differentiate between the 2, the receiver gain has to be reduced. The absence of sea clutter also may indicate that ice is present. Although ridges may show up well on the RADAR display, ridges, closed tracks of ships, and rafted ice have a similar appearance on RADAR. The effectiveness of RADAR systems will vary with power and wavelength. Optimum RADAR settings will be different for navigating on ice than for open water. As the RADAR reflectivity of ice is reduced, the gain will have to be adjusted to detect ice properly. Generally, high-power RADARs are preferred. RADARs with 50 kW output provide much better ice detection capability than 25 kW RADARs. Similarly, 3-centimetre RADARs (x-band) provide better detail, while 10-centimetre RADARs (s-band) detect ice and ridging at a greater distance – therefore, use both wavelengths.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Iceberg Detection\",\n      \"content\": \"Master / OOW: Consider the following for RADAR use to detect icebergs: Icebergs normally have a high freeboard, and as such, they are easy to detect visually (in clear conditions) and by the ship's RADAR. In poor to no visibility, RADAR must be relied upon. The RADAR return from an iceberg with low freeboard, smooth surface, or deep snow cover is less obvious, particularly if surrounded by bright returns from sea or ice clutter. Depending upon their size, aspect, and attitude, icebergs may be detected at ranges between 4-15 nautical miles or even further; detection ranges diminish in fog, rain, and other conditions affecting the attenuation of RADAR return. Iceberg RADAR targets will sometimes cause a “RADAR shadow” on the far side, in which other targets will not show. A large iceberg with a long and gently sloping aspect may not provide enough reflective surfaces to show at all on RADAR, so it should never be assumed that just because there are no targets in view, there are no icebergs around. As the ship gets closer to the iceberg, the size of the RADAR target reduces and may disappear when very close to the iceberg, in which case only the shadow will remain to warn of the iceberg's presence. For this reason, plot any iceberg (which has not been sighted visually) that the ship may be approaching until the point of nearest approach has passed.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Bergy Bit and Growler Detection\",\n      \"content\": \"Pieces of ice sometimes break off or collapse from an iceberg. The larger pieces are known as bergy bits, and the smaller pieces are known as growlers. Whereas the iceberg moves in a direction that is primarily the result of current because of its large keel area, the growlers and bergy bits are primarily wind driven, and will stream leeward of the iceberg. While this is the general case, the effects of strong tidal currents may alter this pattern. Master / OOW: Move to the windward of icebergs to avoid bergy bits and growlers. The passing distance from the iceberg is a function of the circumstances: The closer the passage, the more likely the encounter with bergy bits. Avoid passing very close to avoid protruding underwater portions of the iceberg away from the visible edge of the iceberg at the sea surface. Check carefully for radar shadows, which may identify bergy bits with less height differential or when the ice or water background is more cluttered. Detection of bergy bits by RADAR is difficult in pack ice, especially if there is any rafting, ridging, or hummocks that cause backscatter and also may produce shadows that can obscure a bergy bit. Growlers, because of their low freeboard and smooth relief, are the most difficult form of glacial ice to detect (both visually and on RADAR) and, therefore, are the most hazardous form of ice. The exact location of each growler cannot be identified for certain amongst ice floes; therefore, determine a safe speed through the ice-covered area when navigating by RADAR.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Old Ice Floes\",\n      \"content\": \"Old ice can be distinguished from first-year ice by a more rounded and weathered surface, light blue color, higher freeboard, and a well-defined system of melt-water channels.

Master / OOW: Make every effort to minimize risk of collision with ice or other ships in poor visibility: Maintain a constant visual and RADAR lookout. Use searchlights at night (which may be counter-productive in fog or precipitation through reflected glare). Reduce speed before entering any ice field in poor visibility. Do not increase speed before determining the threat. Reduce the speed in any ice situation where the ratio of glacial and old ice to first year ice indicates a significant increase in the chance of collision with hazardous ice. Identify the location of icebergs, bergy bits, and growlers on RADAR before they are obscured by sea or ice clutter, and track these targets on ARPA. Switch between ranges to optimize the RADAR for iceberg detection when in pack ice. Use the RADAR to detect icebergs and bergy bits by observing their RADAR shadows in mixed ice cover. Recognize the difficulty of detecting glacial and old ice in open pack ice with RADAR when little or no RADAR shadow is recognizable. Follow the icebreaker and maintain the required distance by RADAR. If the icebreaker suddenly slows or its position is lost on the RADAR screen, a collision may occur.

Route planning relies on weather forecasts and available publications on the ice climatology of the region to be encountered in addition to standard nautical publications. Develop a route to the destination based on the information obtained in the appraisal stage, and lay it off on the appropriate ENCs. Use the same principles as in open water passage planning.

The refrigerator and freezer compartments must operate under conditions which will prevent the development of bacteria and ensure your food is preserved properly. Monitor the temperatures of the refrigerated rooms in predetermined intervals. Fluctuating temperatures may cause an accumulation of ice deposits. Calibrate refrigerators and freezers’ thermometers to monitor fridge temperature. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved. Keeping a Temperature Log is the indicative way to refrigerator and freezer temperatures proper monitoring. This enables you to get regular accurate temperature readings and thus be reassured that your food is being well-preserved. Assign this task to a designated Galley crewmember and make sure that time, air, temperature and his name and signature are properly logged. Take the measurements once in the morning (Daily Refrigerator / Freezer / Storage Room Temperature Log) (please refer to Tables 1 and 2)."}, {"name": "The Ideal Temperatures for Your Refrigerator and Freezer", "content": "Starting With Your Freezers. Ship’s freezers in which you store meat, poultry, fish and vegetables, must be set at -17 0C, to slow the metabolic rate of spoilage and preserve your foods' nutrient level."}, {"name": "Essential Freezing Tips", "content": "To reduce food loss in your freezer, make sure to store food in airtight containers and be sure to date everything, for monitoring purposes, in order to avoid consuming freezer burned goods. Prevent freezer burn by using freezer-friendly bags and remove as much air as possible from containers and bags of food to avoid spoilage. If freezing soups, stews and other dishes that are high in liquids, remember that when frozen, food expands, so be sure to leave headspace on your container to avoid bursting. Misplacing your food may lead to loss through overcooling and/or undercooling. Avoid storing sensitive items near the refrigerator door where temperatures are more likely to fluctuate. Label foods before freezing with the date and its contents. Make at least one meal per week to use up freezer foods. Deep frozen food which has been defrosted is not to be refrozen. Eliminate the risks of cross contamination by thoroughly stripping and cleaning the relevant parts of equipment when successive different foods are to be used (especially raw and cooked foods). Do note place defrosting food anywhere near cooked food, or preparation counters. There is a high risk of food contamination caused by the leaking fluids."}, {"name": "The Right Refrigerator Temperatures", "content": "As a rule, the interior temperature of a refrigerator varies between 30C and 50C, with Food Safety Organizations recommending that the ideal temperature must be set below 40C. Keep in mind that the temperature is not the same at different levels of your refrigerator. As a rule, the bottom of the fridge is the coldest and the temperature rises as you climb. For example, on the middle shelf, the average temperature is approximately 50C, while the lowest shelves are colder, at about 20C. This is why you should place different foods in different levels, depending on their needs in terms of temperature: Store your vegetables and fruits in the bottom drawers. Put your dairy and deli products on the middle shelf. Store precooked and ready to eat items on the top shelf. Avoid overloading the refrigerator. An overstock can impede the free circulation of air, which can lead to both warm and cold pockets in the refrigerator that can speed up spoilage. However, at the other extreme, you should also keep in mind that a refrigerator left virtually empty will consume more energy than a well-stocked one."}, {"name": "Housekeeping and Maintenance of Refrigerators and Freezers Guide", "content": "Keep refrigerated spaces in clean and sanitary condition. Store food securely. Keep shelves, racks, gratings, refrigerating coils and rails free of scraps of food and packaging material. Properly dispose scraps of vegetables and decayed fruits in garbage disposal facilities, as soon as identified. Keep scuppers free for proper drainage. Keep refrigerated spaces ventilated to prevent damage to provisions. Entry into these spaces is restricted to minimum necessary for efficient operation. Cook: Notify the C/E when it is intended to wash refrigerators or chill rooms. In the event of technical problems with refrigeration plant, follow the C/E's recommendations concerning frequency of access to chambers. Keep all rooms thoroughly clean and hygienic. Keep refrigerators in mess rooms and pantries in clean and sanitary condition at all times. Remove any solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) used as packaging for frozen goods in transit to the vessel, before goods are placed in refrigerated rooms."}, {"name": "Safety procedures when working in refrigerated spaces", "content": "No one enters a refrigerated room without first informing a responsible person who must be instructed to raise the alarm if an absence is prolonged. The space or flat in which refrigerated machinery is installed must be adequately ventilated and illuminated. All refrigerated rooms must have means of opening the door from the inside and an inside alarm button which must be tested at least weekly. Those likely to enter the refrigerated spaces must make themselves familiar, in the dark, with the alarm and the release systems. Always secure refrigerators doors, when opened. Do not allow it to swing freely. If padlocks are fitted, take the padlock inside, when entering the space. Keep all doors to refrigerated rooms securely closed and locked at all times and, when closed, extinguish all lights. Freon gas, when heated, gives off toxic fumes. Entirely empty all lines and machinery of gas before commencing any hot work repairs. Keep thereafter the appropriate valves open to prevent pressure build up. No one enters the refrigerated space if leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected (freon has a distinctive oily smell). In this event: Post a warning notice on the respective doors. Follow “Enclosed Space” precautions before entering a space suspected or known to be contaminated with leaking refrigerant which can displace air and cause suffocation. If it is necessary to enter the space where a leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected, the space must be thoroughly ventilated and those entering be protected by breathing apparatus.

Prevent freezer burn by using freezer-friendly bags and remove as much air as possible from containers and bags of food to avoid spoilage. If freezing soups, stews and other dishes that are high in liquids, remember that when frozen, food expands, so be sure to leave headspace on your container to avoid bursting. Misplacing your food may lead to loss through overcooling and/or undercooling. Avoid storing sensitive items near the refrigerator door where temperatures are more likely to fluctuate. Label foods before freezing with the date and its contents. Make at least one meal per week to use up freezer foods. Deep frozen food which has been defrosted is not to be refrozen. Eliminate the risks of cross contamination by thoroughly stripping and cleaning the relevant parts of equipment when successive different foods are to be used (especially raw and cooked foods). Do note place defrosting food anywhere near cooked food, or preparation counters.

Keep in mind that the temperature is not the same at different levels of your refrigerator. As a rule, the bottom of the fridge is the coldest and the temperature rises as you climb. For example, on the middle shelf, the average temperature is approximately 50C, while the lowest shelves are colder, at about 20C. This is why you should place different foods in different levels, depending on their needs in terms of temperature: Store your vegetables and fruits in the bottom drawers. Put your dairy and deli products on the middle shelf. Store precooked and ready to eat items on the top shelf. Avoid overloading the refrigerator. An overstock can impede the free circulation of air, which can lead to both warm and cold pockets in the refrigerator that can speed up spoilage. However, at the other extreme, you should also keep in mind that a refrigerator left virtually empty will consume more energy than a well-stocked one.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Housekeeping and Maintenance of Refrigerators and Freezers Guide\",\n      \"content\": \"Keep refrigerated spaces in clean and sanitary condition.

Keep all doors to refrigerated rooms securely closed and locked at all times and, when closed, extinguish all lights. Freon gas, when heated, gives off toxic fumes. Entirely empty all lines and machinery of gas before commencing any hot work repairs. Keep thereafter the appropriate valves open to prevent pressure build up. No one enters the refrigerated space if leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected (freon has a distinctive oily smell). In this event: Post a warning notice on the respective doors. Follow “Enclosed Space” precautions before entering a space suspected or known to be contaminated with leaking refrigerant which can displace air and cause suffocation. If it is necessary to enter the space where a leakage of refrigerant (Freon) is known or suspected, the space must be thoroughly ventilated and those entering be protected by breathing apparatus.

Interview/take statements (form NCR 005) as soon as possible (or verify/review existing statements) from the persons involved and any other person who can contribute to establishing or corroborating the facts (including the injured, if possible, the supervisors of those involved in the incident and relevant experts). Review documents/records and identify the applicable Company\ts procedures and regulatory requirements the individuals involved followed or should have followed. Collect data including all applicable procedures, manuals, records, or instructions given for the job under investigation, i.e., plans, messages concerning the work, etc. Take copies of logbooks, purchase orders, work permits, maintenance records, test results, scene photos or diagrams, record environmental conditions, etc. Determine if all the relevant equipment was in full working order and operated correctly or if an equipment failure was a contributing factor. Retain any equipment involved in the condition immediately after the incident, if possible, until you receive further instructions. Catalog carefully, preserve all documentation/physical evidence, and keep it secure until the investigation is complete. Some of the following questions may assist in finding the root cause of an incident: How long/frequently does the employee perform the activity under investigation? Is the activity repetitive? Did the employee use PPE? Is PPE compulsory for the task? If it is compulsory, but the employee did not use it, ask why. Are there any stress factors (work/rest hours, noise, lighting, weather, etc.)? Does the employee take adequate breaks? What was he doing during the break? Is there pressure to get the job done quickly? How long has the employee worked in the job? What training has he received? What other activities did the employee perform on that day? What are the employee's job responsibilities? What is the employee's work history (previous accidents, etc.)? Look for the points that depend on the incident circumstances. For example, after an incident during access, note the following: The type/origin of the access equipment, e.g., ship's own, provided from shore, etc. The access equipment condition, e.g., any damage such as broken guardrail, the damage position/extent, whether the damage preexisted, appeared during the accident or resulted from it, etc. Any external factors' effect on the equipment condition, e.g., oil on the surface The equipment deployment, i.e., its shipboard ends, quayside location, etc. The equipment rigging, securing method, approximate inclination angle The use of ancillary equipment (safety net, lifebuoy and lifeline, lighting) The safety of shipboard and quayside approach to equipment, e.g., guardrails The weather conditions The performance, knowledge, and personal characteristics of employee(s) involved The maintenance history, including equipment modifications.

Retain any equipment involved in the condition immediately after the incident, if possible, until you receive further instructions. Catalog carefully, preserve all documentation/physical evidence, and keep it secure until the investigation is complete. Some of the following questions may assist in finding the root cause of an incident: How long/frequently does the employee perform the activity under investigation? Is the activity repetitive? Did the employee use PPE? Is PPE compulsory for the task? If it is compulsory, but the employee did not use it, ask why. Are there any stress factors (work/rest hours, noise, lighting, weather, etc.)? Does the employee take adequate breaks? What was he doing during the break? Is there pressure to get the job done quickly? How long has the employee worked in the job? What training has he received? What other activities did the employee perform on that day? What are the employee's job responsibilities? What is the employee's work history (previous accidents, etc.)? Look for the points that depend on the incident circumstances. For example, after an incident during access, note the following: The type/origin of the access equipment, e.g., ship's own, provided from shore, etc. The access equipment condition, e.g., any damage such as broken guardrail, the damage position/extent, whether the damage preexisted, appeared during the accident or resulted from it, etc. Any external factors' effect on the equipment condition, e.g., oil on the surface The equipment deployment, i.e., its shipboard ends, quayside location, etc. The equipment rigging, securing method, approximate inclination angle The use of ancillary equipment (safety net, lifebuoy and lifeline, lighting) The safety of shipboard and quayside approach to equipment, e.g., guardrails The weather conditions The performance, knowledge, and personal characteristics of employee(s) involved The maintenance history, including equipment modifications.

RNCs will not trigger automatic alarms (e.g., anti-grounding). However, alarms and indications can be generated with the manual addition, during passage planning, e.g., of clearing lines, ship safety contour lines, isolated danger markers and danger areas to mitigate these limitations. Horizontal datums and chart projections may differ between RNCs. Mariners must understand how a chart's horizontal datum relates to the datum of the position fixing system in use. In some instances, this may appear as a shift in position. This difference may be most noticeable at grid intersections. A number of RNCs cannot be referenced to either WGS-84 or PE 90 geodetic datums. Where this is the case, ECDIS must give a continuous indication. The display of RNCs features cannot be simplified by the removal of features to suit a particular navigational circumstance or task. This could affect the superimposition of radar/ARPA. Without selecting different scale charts, the look-ahead capability may be limited. This may lead to inconvenience when determining range and bearing or the identity of distant objects. Orientation of the RCDS display to other than chart-up may affect the readability of chart text and symbols (e.g., course-up, route-up). It is not possible to interrogate RNC features to gain additional information about charted objects. Whether using ENC or RNC in the planning process, consult all relevant publications (such as sailing directions, etc.). With RNC, it is not possible to display a ship's safety contour or depth and highlight it on the display unless these features are manually entered during route planning. Depending on the source of RNC, different colors may be used to show similar chart information. There may also be differences in colors used during day and night time. A RNC is intended to be used at the scale of the equivalent paper chart. Excessive zooming in or out can degrade the displayed image. If the RNC is displayed at a larger scale than the equivalent paper chart, the ECDIS will provide an indication. ECDIS provides an indication in the ENC which allows a determination of the quality of hydrographic the data.

This offers maximum choice and the flexibility to match your chart holdings to your operational patterns. When they are loaded into the ECDIS, ENCs are converted to the system’s own proprietary format, known as System ENC (SENC). To allow them to load more efficiently, some service providers convert AVCS ENCs to SENC ashore, then send them to the vessel, usually by download. Before loading AVCS ENCs, the ENC Permits must be installed on the system. Each permit is unique and is the method which provides access to the required ENCs. The ENC Permits are supplied by the ENC service provider in a zipped file. The contents of this file will depend on the number of ECDIS units onboard, as each AVCS license allows for use on up to five ECDIS. When extracted, one or more set of permit files (PERMIT.TXT and ENC.PMT) will be copied automatically into folder(s) named MASTER, BACKUP, RESERVE1, RESERVE2 and RESERVE3, depending on the number of ECDIS configured on the bridge. Most ENC Producers grant permission for their data to be displayed many times on a single vessel licence. However, where permission is restricted to a smaller number of ECDIS displays, those permits will only be included in the appropriate number of permit files, in the order given above.

Ensure that appropriate largest scale ENCs are used. Ensure that the compilation scale of each ENC is used. Pay particular attention to where ENCs overlap. A detailed check is essential where ENCs overlap, to ensure that no critical data has been obscured. Overlapping cells are listed in the README file (see Paragraph 7.8 ). CAUTION Add waypoints: Use the graphical method to construct a route. On an appropriately scaled ENC, start by adding a waypoint in the vicinity of the initial location using the cursor. When 2 waypoints are inserted, the system automatically joins them to form legs, which are rhumb lines by default. Remaining on small scale ENCs, and utilizing the knowledge received during appraisal stage, construct the route by adding all necessary waypoints till the final destination. Waypoints position need only be approximate at this stage, or Use the tabular method, where the latitude and longitude of waypoints are entered manually in the route table. Leg details such as true course and distance, can be viewed in the route table or chosen display, where available, along the route itself. Adjust waypoints. Once the entire route is planned on small scale charts, return to the start position and conduct a more accurate planning by fine-tuning the waypoints, using appropriate large-scale charts. Place waypoints as accurately as possible. Note A route planning software can be used to create and review optimum voyage routes. The software is integrated with chart management and ordering tools, overlays of NAVAREA warnings, etc. Consider the following when adding or adjusting waypoints: Ship considerations: Draft in relation to available depth and width of navigable water and minimum required UKC Effect on ship’s draft and turning circle during course alteration: - Planned speed - ROT restrictions - Effect of expected tidal stream - Effect of expected current - Increase in draft due to squat and heel effect. Optimal fuel efficiency. Route considerations: Adequate XTC Alterations of speed enroute Avoidance of danger areas Contingency/emergency planning: - Points of non-return - Place of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of an emergency - Shore-based emergency response arrangements and equipment. Depth of water, Tidal restrictions Limitations of night passage Location of course alterations Method and frequency of position verification Piracy and security Pilot station(s). Place a waypoint at the pilot station to ensure accurate ETA Protection of the environment Safe speed and proximity of navigational hazards Territorial baselines Use of ship’s routeing, reporting systems and VTS. Note By default, ECDIS will create legs as rhumb lines, but for ocean passages this can be changed to a Great Circle line. Plot specific details of T&P / EP NMs, navigational warnings, NAVTEX messages and local information as a manual layer and made alarmable by using the look-ahead feature to highlight the navigational hazards for the OOW. The manual layers must be displayed at least within 50 nm on either side of the planned track. Define the ship’s safe speed for each leg of the planned route. Apply any guidance or direction related to ship’s route as per the charterers orders. Calculate the safety depths and safety contours and set them up in line with the UKC requirements (see Paragraph 13 ). Set maximum acceptable cross track corridor (XTC) to each leg of a route (see Paragraph 13.9 ). Define the look-ahead zone (see Paragraph 13.8 ) Set parallel indexing where appropriate. Define abort points, critical points and emergency anchorages. Calculate the wheel-over positions with the applicable rate of turn. Plot no-go areas. Set ETA using the route planning tools. Be aware that if this is set incorrectly, it may affect tidal data, UKC calculations and time dependent information for the route. Note When the ship regularly visits a certain Port or frequently transits an area, it is advantageous to keep the whole or part of the passage plan as it is. Unless changes are made to channels, navaids, etc. a planned passage is acceptable for future visits, taking into account the meteorological and tidal differences and that inward and outward passages may be different. Parts of the plans may have common features that can be used. If reusing a previous passage plan, then recheck the route to confirm that it remains safe and no changes are necessary.

Calculate the ship’s stopping value in accordance to the ship’s condition (laden or ballast). Get the values from wheelhouse poster and/or the maneuvering booklet. Double this value to allow for external factors like current and wind. Consider an additional distance that the ship would cover in 6 minutes. These 6 minutes are to allow for analyzing the traffic around before you start to turn the ship. Mark the abort point at the determined position close to the defined clear distance in the forward. Basis to the above, a formula to determine the abort point from the nearest safety margin is: Abort Point = 2 x maximum value of stopping distance in various conditions + distance that the ship navigates in 6 minutes at the planned speed If ship puts hard over at this point , she will touch the nearest safety of margin.

RNCs will not trigger automatic alarms (e.g., anti-grounding). However, alarms and indications can be generated with the manual addition, during passage planning, e.g., of clearing lines, ship safety contour lines, isolated danger markers and danger areas to mitigate these limitations. Horizontal datums and chart projections may differ between RNCs. Mariners must understand how a chart's horizontal datum relates to the datum of the position fixing system in use. In some instances, this may appear as a shift in position. This difference may be most noticeable at grid intersections. A number of RNCs cannot be referenced to either WGS-84 or PE 90 geodetic datums. Where this is the case, ECDIS must give a continuous indication. The display of RNCs features cannot be simplified by the removal of features to suit a particular navigational circumstance or task. This could affect the superimposition of radar/ARPA. Without selecting different scale charts, the look-ahead capability may be limited. This may lead to inconvenience when determining range and bearing or the identity of distant objects. Orientation of the RCDS display to other than chart-up may affect the readability of chart text and symbols (e.g., course-up, route-up). It is not possible to interrogate RNC features to gain additional information about charted objects. Whether using ENC or RNC in the planning process, consult all relevant publications (such as sailing directions, etc.). With RNC, it is not possible to display a ship's safety contour or depth and highlight it on the display unless these features are manually entered during route planning. Depending on the source of RNC, different colors may be used to show similar chart information. There may also be differences in colors used during day and night time. A RNC is intended to be used at the scale of the equivalent paper chart. Excessive zooming in or out can degrade the displayed image. If the RNC is displayed at a larger scale than the equivalent paper chart, the ECDIS will provide an indication. ECDIS provides an indication in the ENC which allows a determination of the quality of hydrographic the data. When using RNCs, consult the source diagram or the zone of confidence diagram, if available.

AVCS Folios and ENC Units may be added to an AVCS licence at any time for periods of 3, 6, 9 or 12 months (where data supply agreements allow). This offers maximum choice and the flexibility to match your chart holdings to your operational patterns. When they are loaded into the ECDIS, ENCs are converted to the system’s own proprietary format, known as System ENC (SENC). To allow them to load more efficiently, some service providers convert AVCS ENCs to SENC ashore, then send them to the vessel, usually by download. Before loading AVCS ENCs, the ENC Permits must be installed on the system. Each permit is unique and is the method which provides access to the required ENCs. The ENC Permits are supplied by the ENC service provider in a zipped file. The contents of this file will depend on the number of ECDIS units onboard, as each AVCS license allows for use on up to five ECDIS. When extracted, one or more set of permit files (PERMIT.TXT and ENC.PMT) will be copied automatically into folder(s) named MASTER, BACKUP, RESERVE1, RESERVE2 and RESERVE3, depending on the number of ECDIS configured on the bridge. Most ENC Producers grant permission for their data to be displayed many times on a single vessel licence. However, where permission is restricted to a smaller number of ECDIS displays, those permits will only be included in the appropriate number of permit files, in the order given above. It is therefore important that priority displays are identified correctly on your licence otherwise some data may not be available when needed. The permits must be extracted to a physical media, e.g., USB flash drive, separately by email, downloaded over the internet, or directly from back of bridge software applications. The contents should be extracted to a file location that is capable of being read by the ECDIS system (read the ENC distributor’s Manual). A new set of ENC Permits will be supplied by the ENC distributor whenever an ENC has been added or removed from the ship’s licence. These should be installed on the ECDIS when they are received, before loading any new exchange sets. The company has decided to proceed with PAYS subscriptions, providing the managed ships with permits for the majority of the AVCS portfolio, so they are available for voyage planning. Basis to this agreement with the ENC distributor the Master and the Navigating Officers will avoid having to purchase the ENCs individually. The ship is only charged for their use when your vessel tracks across the coverage of each ENC. The ENC data must still be loaded onto your ECDIS either manually or automatically. CAUTION Note Master and Navigation Officer: Report to ENC service provider the instances where an ENC cell has failed to install.

A detailed check is essential where ENCs overlap, to ensure that no critical data has been obscured. Overlapping cells are listed in the README file (see Paragraph 7.8 ). CAUTION Add waypoints: Use the graphical method to construct a route. On an appropriately scaled ENC, start by adding a waypoint in the vicinity of the initial location using the cursor. When 2 waypoints are inserted, the system automatically joins them to form legs, which are rhumb lines by default. Remaining on small scale ENCs, and utilizing the knowledge received during appraisal stage, construct the route by adding all necessary waypoints till the final destination. Waypoints position need only be approximate at this stage, or Use the tabular method, where the latitude and longitude of waypoints are entered manually in the route table. Leg details such as true course and distance, can be viewed in the route table or chosen display, where available, along the route itself. Adjust waypoints. Once the entire route is planned on small scale charts, return to the start position and conduct a more accurate planning by fine-tuning the waypoints, using appropriate large-scale charts. Place waypoints as accurately as possible. Note A route planning software can be used to create and review optimum voyage routes. The software is integrated with chart management and ordering tools, overlays of NAVAREA warnings, etc. Consider the following when adding or adjusting waypoints: Ship considerations: Draft in relation to available depth and width of navigable water and minimum required UKC Effect on ship’s draft and turning circle during course alteration: - Planned speed - ROT restrictions - Effect of expected tidal stream - Effect of expected current - Increase in draft due to squat and heel effect. Optimal fuel efficiency. Route considerations: Adequate XTC Alterations of speed enroute Avoidance of danger areas Contingency/emergency planning: - Points of non-return - Place of refuge or safe anchorage in the event of an emergency - Shore-based emergency response arrangements and equipment. Depth of water, Tidal restrictions Limitations of night passage Location of course alterations Method and frequency of position verification Piracy and security Pilot station(s). Place a waypoint at the pilot station to ensure accurate ETA Protection of the environment Safe speed and proximity of navigational hazards Territorial baselines Use of ship’s routeing, reporting systems and VTS. Note By default, ECDIS will create legs as rhumb lines, but for ocean passages this can be changed to a Great Circle line. Plot specific details of T&P / EP NMs, navigational warnings, NAVTEX messages and local information as a manual layer and made alarmable by using the look-ahead feature to highlight the navigational hazards for the OOW. The manual layers must be displayed at least within 50 nm on either side of the planned track. Define the ship’s safe speed for each leg of the planned route. Apply any guidance or direction related to ship’s route as per the charterers orders. Calculate the safety depths and safety contours and set them up in line with the UKC requirements (see Paragraph 13 ). Set maximum acceptable cross track corridor (XTC) to each leg of a route (see Paragraph 13.9 ). Define the look-ahead zone (see Paragraph 13.8 ) Set parallel indexing where appropriate. Define abort points, critical points and emergency anchorages. Calculate the wheel-over positions with the applicable rate of turn. Plot no-go areas. Set ETA using the route planning tools. Be aware that if this is set incorrectly, it may affect tidal data, UKC calculations and time dependent information for the route. Note When the ship regularly visits a certain Port or frequently transits an area, it is advantageous to keep the whole or part of the passage plan as it is. Unless changes are made to channels, navaids, etc. a planned passage is acceptable for future visits, taking into account the meteorological and tidal differences and that inward and outward passages may be different. Parts of the plans may have common features that can be used. If reusing a previous passage plan, then recheck the route to confirm that it remains safe and no changes are necessary.
