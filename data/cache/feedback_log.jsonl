This includes:\n*   Avoiding entry into the dangerous zone (where average wave length is larger than 0.8 L and significant wave height is larger than 0.04 L, and dangerous behavior indices are seen).\n*   Reducing speed or changing course to prevent successive attacks of high waves.\n*   Selecting course and speed to avoid the encounter wave period (TE) being nearly equal to the natural rolling period (TR) or half of the natural rolling period (0.5 x TR) [7, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Dangerous Phenomena during Heavy Weather].\n\n### Access to Main Deck\n\nAccess to the main deck must be restricted and is only permitted when necessary for the safety of the ship, crew, or the safety of life at sea. When access is permitted, the Master must ensure the following conditions are met:\n1.  A Risk Assessment is undertaken.\n2.  The seafarers go on deck in pairs or teams, supervised by a competent person.\n3.  The ship is handled with caution to provide suitable lee to the exposed personnel.\n4.  Adequate communication between the bridge and personnel on deck is maintained.\n5.  Any seafarers required to go on deck wear a suitable lifejacket, a safety harness (which can be attached to lifelines), and waterproof PPE, including full head protection.\n6.  All safety precautions are taken to prevent injury or man overboard situations according to Chapter 7.9.18 and form P 008 [1, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Access to Main Deck during Heavy Weather].\n    *Note: The policy also specifies that personnel must be equipped with a water-resistant UHF radio when going on deck during adverse weather [1, Chapter 7.2 NAVIGATION > Access to Main Deck during Heavy Weather].*", "confidence_pct": 92, "confidence_level": "HIGH 🟢", "num_sources": 30, "top_sources": ["Chapter 7.2.docx", "CHECK_N_010_NAVIGATION_IN_HEAVY_WEATHER_AND_TROPICAL_STORM_(LAMINATED).docx", "Chapter 7.2.docx"], "retriever_type": "unknown", "feedback": "helpful", "correction": "", "attempts": 1, "was_refined": true}

{"timestamp": "2025-10-29T16:08:07.593249", "query": "how to properly assess risk for transitting the malacca straits?", "answer": "Based on the documents on file, the proper assessment of risk for navigating the Malacca Straits without a Pilot involves a structured risk management procedure, which includes identifying the activity, analyzing hazards, applying controls, evaluating risk, and establishing contingency plans.\n\nThe assessment process, defined in the \"Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot\" procedure, requires the following steps:\n\n### 1. Risk Identification and Analysis\n\nThe assessment must identify the operation (Routine Non-routine activity) and analyze potential hazardous events associated with navigation without a pilot [7, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Management].\n\nKey hazards identified include:\n\n| Hazard | Potential Hazardous Event |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Lack of “real time” information on local dangers. | Moderate cost or damage |\n| Lack of navigation guidance & cooperation to avoid hazards. | Moderate cost or damage |\n| Lack of knowledge of accurate ship’s position. | Moderate cost or damage, Serious injury to personnel |\n| Lack of knowledge of water depth. | Moderate cost or damage, Serious injury to personnel |\n| Lack of traffic knowledge. | Moderate cost or damage, Serious injury to personnel |\n| Lack of knowledge of actual heading. | Moderate cost or damage |\n| Lack of engine readiness. | Moderate cost or damage, Serious injury to personnel |\n| Lack of timely emergency response. | Moderate cost or damage |\n| Lack of manpower. | Serious injury to personnel |\n\nSources: [1, 2, 3, 4, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Assessment]\n\n### 2. Initial Risk Evaluation\n\nThe initial risk (R) is evaluated by determining the Frequency (F) and Consequence (C) of the hazard.\n\n*   **Frequency Categories (F):** Ranging from 1 (Very unlikely—Once per 30 years or more) to 5 (Frequent—More often than once per voyage).\n*   **Consequence Categories (C):** Assessing impact on human losses, pollution, cost/damage (e.g., Moderate cost or damage is $100,000 – $1,000,000), and national/international impact.\n*   **Risk Matrix:** The resulting risk (R) is categorized as Low (Negligible Risk), Medium (Tolerable Risk), or High (Intolerable Risk) [6, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > FREQUENCY CATEGORY | CONSEQUENCE CATEGORY | RISK MATRIX].\n\n### 3. Existing Control Measures\n\nThe assessment must confirm the applicability and use of existing control measures, which include adherence to various UMMS chapters (e.g., Performing the Navigation watch and lookout, Standby Engines, Emergency preparedness, Ship’s position fixing, Bridge watch conditions, UKC, and use of navigational equipment like Radar/Arpa, Echo sounder, Gyro/Magnetic compasses, and VHF/GMDSS radio) [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nConsideration must also be given to controls such as:\n*   Up-to-date Navigational Charts and Nautical Publications.\n*   Caution Notes (Navarea messages, NAVTEX warnings).\n*   Quality/nature of the seabed and Sea State.\n*   Adaptation of safe transit speed (to minimize squat).\n*   Accuracy of the ship’s draught and transit during high tide.\n*   Manoeuvrability of the vessel and operational constraints due to UKC.\n*   General and expected movement of traffic in the area and prevailing weather conditions [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\n### 4. Risk Treatment (Additional Control Measures)\n\nIf the initial risk is deemed too high, additional risk control measures must be implemented to reduce the residual risk. These measures include:\n\n| Additional Risk Control Measure | Responsible Party | Action Timeline |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Recalculation of passage plan for the specific part of the voyage with lower speed, in order the squat to be reduced. | Navig. Officer / Master | Prior to passage |\n| Prevailing weather conditions (or expected conditions) to be considered / monitored. | Navig. Officer / Master | Prior to passage |\n| The Master’s and bridge team experience in this particular trading area to be considered. | Operations Manager | Prior to passage |\n| Most recent deepest arrival / departure draft to be requested from port authorities. | Master | Prior to passage |\n| Local agents to be contacted in writing and requested the actual depth of port entry/berth/loading/discharging areas or SBM/CBM and the maximum permitted draft. | Master | Prior to arrival at loading/ discharging port/passing area |\n| Additional information from port authorities, pilots, etc., regarding the local environmental conditions, traffic density, seabed characteristics, etc., to be obtained. | Master | Prior to passage |\n| During the passage, tugs to be stand-by. | Operations Manager in co-operation with local agent | During passage |\n\nSource: [5, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Treatment | Residual risk evaluation]\n\n### 5. Contingency Planning\n\nContingency plans must be established to facilitate safe management and recovery in case of unplanned occurrences [9, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Contingency plans...]. Specifically, in case of a contingency situation (e.g., touching bottom/grounding), emergency response teams should be activated, and company procedures described in the ‘Emergency Response Plan’ and ‘SOPEP’ must be followed [5, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Treatment | Residual risk evaluation].\n\n### 6. Documentation and Approval\n\nThe risk assessment must be documented by the Risk Management Team [10, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Management Team] and formally reviewed and approved by designated personnel, including their Name, Rank/Title, Signature, and Date [8, Risk Management: Navigation in Malacca Straits without Pilot > Risk Assessment reviewed/approved by:].", "confidence_pct": 95, "confidence_level": "HIGH 🟢", "num_sources": 30, "top_sources": ["1.1.24 Navigation in Malacca str. without Pilot.docx", "1.1.24 Navigation in Malacca str. without Pilot.docx", "1.1.24 Navigation in Malacca str. without Pilot.docx"], "retriever_type": "unknown", "feedback": "helpful", "correction": "", "attempts": 1, "was_refined": true}
